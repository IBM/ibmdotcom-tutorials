    "title": "Tool calling in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the ability of the LLM to interact with external tools, services, or APIs to perform tasks. This  allows LLMs to extend their functionality, enhancing their ability to handle real-world tasks that may require access to external data, real-time information, or specific applications. When an LLM uses a web search tool, it can call the web to fetch real-time data that aren't available in the model's training data. Other types of tools might include Python for calculations, data analysis, or visualization, or calling a service endpoint for data. Tool calling can make a chatbot more dynamic and adaptable, allowing it to provide more accurate, relevant, and detailed responses based on live data or specialized tasks outside its immediate knowledge base. Popular frameworks for tool-calling include Langchain and now ollama.",

Graph RAG is an alternative to vector search methods that use a vector database. Knowledge graphs are knowledge systems where graph databases such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune can represent structured data. In a knowledge graph, the relationships between data points, called edges, are as meaningful as the connections between data points, called vertices or sometimes nodes. A knowledge graph makes it easy to traverse a network and process complex queries about connected data. Knowledge graphs are especially well suited for use cases involving chatbots, identity resolution, network analysis, recommendation engines, customer 360 and fraud detection.",
