Customer Service Interaction Transcript  

Cynthia:
Hi, I'm calling because I received a jar of peanut butter that was open and it's completely spilled everywhere. This is really frustrating, and I need a replacement.

Gerald (Peanut Butter Inc.):
Ugh, that sucks. But, like, how did you not notice it was open before you bought it?

Cynthia:
Excuse me? I didn't expect the jar to be open when I received it. It was sealed when I bought it. Can you just help me out here?

Gerald:
Yeah, whatever. But we can't control how it gets to you. I mean, it's not like we throw the jars around or anything. You're probably being dramatic.

Cynthia:
I'm not being dramatic. The peanut butter is literally all over the box and it's a mess. I just want a replacement or a refund, that's all.

Gerald:
Look, I guess I could send you a replacement, but it's really not our fault, you know? Maybe next time, check the jar before you open it?

Cynthia:
Are you seriously blaming me for your company's mistake? That's not how customer service works!

Gerald:
Well, what do you want me to do? I don't exactly have magic powers to fix your problem instantly. Chill out, we'll send you a new jar eventually.

Cynthia:
That's not good enough! I expect better from a company that I've been buying from for years. Can you just do the right thing and make this right?

Gerald:
Fine, fine. I'll put in a request or whatever. But seriously, this kind of thing happens. Don't make it sound like the end of the world.

Cynthia:
Unbelievable. I'll be posting a review if this isn't fixed immediately.

Gerald:
Cool, go ahead. I'm sure we'll survive your review.

Cynthia:
I'll be contacting your supervisor if this isn't resolved soon.

Gerald:
Yeah, okay. Do what you gotta do.
