# Local Setup
For each tutorial or application, the local set up can vary. We recommend having Python 3.11 and pip installed. For any activities with JavaScript/TypeScript, we recommend having NodeJS version 23.10.0 and npm installed, though yarn may also be required depending on the project.

It may also be necessary to have a local version of [Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite), [ollama](https://ollama.com/), and other tools. Please be sure to check the README for any codebase or the instructions in any tutorial to ensure you have the proper set up prior to attempting any coding or notebook runs.

Note: YMMV - as different machines have different operating parameters, we cannot guarantee all setups will run locally. If you have any questions, please reach out in our [Github Discussions](https://github.com/IBM/ibmdotcom-tutorials/discussions).
