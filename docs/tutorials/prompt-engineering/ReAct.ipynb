    "This tutorial shows how to build an AI agent using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework and the IBM Granite 4.0 Nano language model. The agent uses prompt engineering to combine reasoning steps with an action plan. It processes news URLs, retrieves data from external sources, and generates a structured financial analysis in JSON format. This approach ensures clear, transparent, and grounded results."

    "**What is ReAct Prompting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct framework enhances large language models (LLMs) by combining internal reasoning with external actions. It integrates Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought, or CoT) and Acting (Tool Use) to create an effective ReAct agent capable of dynamic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thought (Reasoning):** The model generates reasoning traces that break down the task, track progress, and plan the next logical step. These traces can operate in few-shot or zero-shot settings, depending on prompt design.\n",
    "- **Action (Acting):** The model follows an action plan to execute tool commands, such as web_browser(url), often managed through frameworks like LangChain.\n",
    "- **Observation:** The agent retrieves external information or data from a knowledge base after executing an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct’s Benefits: It grounds the model in verified external data rather than internal training memory, improving transparency and supporting reliable decision-making in complex tasks."

    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Optimized for fast, low-latency inference through its lightweight architecture and efficient API integration, comparable to how OpenAI models like ChatGPT are deployed.\n",
    "- **Agentic Capability:** Instruction-tuned to follow complex, multi-step prompts with self-consistency in the model’s reasoning. It handles both structured and verbal reasoning, recognizes tool schemas, and produces reliable, JSON-formatted outputs.\n",
    "\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Financial news is rarely straightforward. Articles often mix conflicting signals — for example, a company may report strong sales (positive signal) but its stock may fall due to weak guidance or higher expenses (negative reaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-step summary cannot capture this nuance. The ReAct agent improves question answering and reasoning by working step by step, combining reasoning and action in interleaved trajectories. It uses in-context examples and fact verification to ensure each action step aligns with reliable real-world information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent converts raw news text into structured financial intelligence. It delivers results as one JSON object using Python-based workflows built on machine learning and retrieval techniques like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment:** Categorizes the market impact (Positive, Negative, Mixed, Neutral).\n",
    "- **Topic:** Identifies the main business driver (Earnings, Regulatory, HR/Layoffs, Supply Chain, etc.).\n",
    "- **Summary:** Produces a concise executive summary (3–5 key points) with fact verification, avoiding verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strict JSON schema ensures outputs are instantly consumable by downstream systems and comparable to benchmarks such as HotpotQA or other baseline datasets. This approach supports accurate, real-time financial insight and a grounded final answer."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how to build a financial insight agent using the ReAct framework and the IBM Granite 4.0 Nano language model.\n",
    "You learned how the agent performs reasoning and action steps, retrieves external data through a simulated lookup tool, and produces structured financial summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct workflow helps reduce hallucination by grounding each decision in retrieved information rather than relying only on internal memory.\n",
    "By combining transparent reasoning traces with tool use, the agent provides reliable, auditable financial insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend this tutorial by connecting the agent to live financial APIs or a retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for real‑time market analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the model on IBM watsonx.ai improves speed and scalability, while custom prompts or domain‑specific fine‑tuning can further enhance performance for specialized financial use cases.\n"
