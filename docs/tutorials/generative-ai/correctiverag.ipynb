    "[Large Language Models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) are incredibly powerful, but their knowledge is limited to their training [datasets](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dataset). When answering questions, especially about specific, evolving, or proprietary information, LLMs can hallucinate or provide general, irrelevant answers. [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) helps by giving the LLM relevant retrieved information from external data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all RAG is created equal. Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (cRAG) does not simply build on top of the more traditional RAG, it represents a significant improvement. It's devised to be more robust by evaluating the quality and relevance of the retrieved results. If the context is weak, irrelevant, or from an untrustworthy source, cRAG attempts to find better information through corrective actions or, explicitly refuse to answer rather than fabricating a response. This makes cRAG systems more reliable and trustworthy for critical applications like answering policy-related questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a robust Corrective RAG (cRAG) system using IBM Granite models on Watsonx and LangChain. Similar frameworks like [LlamaIndex](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llamaindex) or [LangGraph](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph) can also be used for building complex RAG flows with distinct nodes. Techniques like [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) can further enhance specific LLM performance for domain-specific RAG. LLMs like those from OpenAI (e.g., [GPT](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpt) models like [ChatGPT](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatgpt)) are also popular choices for such agents, though this tutorial focuses on IBM Granite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll focus on a use case: answering questions about a specific insurance policy document (a PDF). This tutorial will guide you in implementing a sophisticated RAG algorithm that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Retrieves information](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/information-retrieval) from your own PDF document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the internal documents are not sufficient for generating the answer, the agent can use an external web search (Tavily) as a fallback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent intelligently filters out irrelevant external results so the answers are tailored to private policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent will give clear, limited responses, with partial information when available, or a clear refusal where context is missing."

    "This tutorial is a demonstration of creating of an insurance policy query agent designed to analyze policy documents (a PDF brochure) and answer user queries accurately. We use IBM Granite models and LangChain to build the agent with robust retrieval and verification steps ensuring high-quality, source-constrained answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand how the key principles of reliable RAG apply in our use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of key principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal knowledge base (PDF):** The agent's primary source of truth is your provided insurance policy PDF. It converts this document into a searchable vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External search fallback (Tavily):** If the internal knowledge base doesn't have enough information, the agent can consult external web sources via Tavily. Tavily is a search engine built specifically for AI agents and LLMs, which results in a faster and real-time retrieval via its API for RAG based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context scoring:** The LLM-based retrieval evaluator (acting as a grader) will provide a score to the relevance of the items retrieved from your internal PDF while ensuring that only high quality retrieved items are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query rewriting:** For web searches, the agent can rephrase the user's query to improve the chances of finding relevant external information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source verification:** An LLM-powered check evaluates whether external web search results are actually relevant to a private insurance policy, filtering out general information or details about public health programs (like Medi-Cal). This prevents the generation of misleading answers and enables self-correction, aiding in knowledge refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constrained generation:** The final prompt to the LLM strictly instructs it to use only the provided context, offer exact answers, state when information is unavailable, or provide partial answers with explicit limitations. This enhances the adaptability and reliability of the generated responses."
