    "# Fine-tuning Granite with LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA is an efficient method of fine tuning transformers and LLMs which reduces the number of trainable parameters that increases the speed and resource usage of training while retaining the same quality of output. Instead of updating all model weights in a neural network during a full finetuning, LoRA freezes the original pre-trained weights and adds small, trainable low-rank matrices that approximate the changes needed for the new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional benefit of LoRA is that since the pre-trained model weights from the original model are kept frozen, the generated LoRA weight matrix is lightweight and portable and can easily be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this step-by-step tutorial, you'll use [LLaMa Factory](https://llamafactory.readthedocs.io/). LLaMa Factory is a platform for training and fine-tuning LLMs that allows users to tune LLMs on domain-specific datasets, evaluate model performance for specific tasks, and serve models. It has both a web UI and CLI that is user-friendly and supports over 100 LLMs. The platform supports datasets in Alpaca and ShareGPT formats. LLaMa Factory isn’t the only way to fine-tune LLMs, the PEFT library for Parameter-efficient fine-tuning is another option for updating large models. PEFT provides the ability to perform quantized LoRA (QLoRA) to even further compact the fine-tuned model. In this tutorial, you’ll use a non-quantized version of Granite 3.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although LLaMa Factory can runs without the use of extensive compute resources, it does require a GPU and a great deal of memory. In this tutorial you'll use LLaMa Factory on watsonx to provide GPU resources and storage for generated adapter. "

    "\n",
    "The next step is to set up the training configurations and then write the configs to a YAML file that LLaMa-Factory uses to run training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll run Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the subset of the MedReason dataset. LLaMa Factory supports several different types of training. Some of the most commonly used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-Training: where a model undergoes initial training using an extensive dataset to generate responses to fundamental language and ideas.\n",
    "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): where a model receives additional training with annotated data to enhance precision for a particular function or on a specific topic.\n",
    "Reward Modeling: where the model acquires knowledge on how to achieve a specific incentive or reward that will inform its output\n",
    "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Training: is a reinforcement learning (RL) technique where the model is further honed through policy gradient techniques to boost its effectiveness in a specific setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many settings used in configuring LoRA but a few of the most commonly used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Rate (LR): the learning rate determines how significantly model parameters are updated during each iteration of training. A higher LR can speed up convergence by allowing larger updates but risks overshooting the optimal solution or oscillating around it. A lower LR leads to slower but more stable convergence, reducing the risk of instability near the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "loraplus_lr_ratio: this sets the the ratio of learning rates. Generally it should be > 1, but the optimal choice of loraplus_lr_ratio is model and task dependent. As a rule of thumb, loraplus_lr_ratio should be larger when the task is more difficult and the model needs to update its features to learn well. In this case, it helps to make the learning rate slightly smaller (e.g., by a factor of 2) than typical vanilla LoRA learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective Batch Size: Correctly configuring your batch size is critical for balancing training stability with the VRAM limitations of the GPU you're using. The Effective Batch Size is set by the product of `per_device_train_batch_size` * `gradient_accumulation_steps`. A larger Effective Batch Size generally leads to smoother, more stable training, but also may require more VRAM than your GPU contains. A smaller Effective Batch Size may introduce more variance."
