    "# Build a spam text classifier by using PyTorch \n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Anna Gutowska\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to take control of your inbox to keep your personal information safe. The objective is to build a [text classifier](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-classification) with [PyTorch](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pytorch) that identifies and filters out unwanted or unsolicited communications, also known as spam. With high accuracy, your [machine learning (ML)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning) classifier sifts through your messages and separates the important ones from the junk.\n",

    "*“CONGRATULATIONS! You’ve won a free prize! Click here to claim it.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "*“Your account has been compromised. Click here to reset your password.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "How often are you flooded with emails and text messages like these? Did you win a free iPhone or is the suspicious link a way to steal your information? Modern-day email providers do a good job at filtering these emails as spam. However, these scams can reach us in many forms like text messages, phone calls or even paper mail. Let’s take spam detection into our own hands with PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is text classification? \n",
    "[Text classification](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-classification) is a [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning) task that involves assigning predefined labels to text data in order to automatically categorize it into groups. This technique is fundamental to [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) applications such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spam detection**: Identifying unwanted or unsolicited emails or messages. This application is the one we explore in this tutorial.\n",
    "* **[Sentiment analysis](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/sentiment-analysis)**: Determining the emotional tone of a piece of text (for example, positive, negative or neutral).\n",
    "* **[Topic modeling](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/topic-modeling)**: Categorizing text into topics or themes (for example, sports, politics or entertainment).\n",
    "* **Intent detection**:  Identifying the purpose or intention behind a piece of text (for example, booking a flight or making a complaint)."

    "## How it works\n",
    "The text classification process typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the text data, which might include\n",
    "    - Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "    - Stopword removal: Removing common words like \"the\" or \"and\" with low sementatic significance.\n",
    "    - Stemming or lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature extraction**: Converting the preprocessed text into a numerical representation that can be used by a machine learning algorithm, such as:\n",
    "    - [Bag-of-words](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/bag-of-words): Representing text as a vector of word frequencies.\n",
    "    - Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF): Multiplies Term Frequency (TF) measures how often a word appears in a document and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measures how rare a word is across all documents in a collection. \n",
    "    - [Word embeddings](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/word-embeddings): Representing words as vectors in a multidimensional space, where the distance and direction between vectors reflect the similarity and relationships among the corresponding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model training**: Training a machine learning model on the labeled text data by using a classification algorithm such as:\n",
    "    - [Naive Bayes](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/naive-bayes)\n",
    "    - [Support vector machines (SVM)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine)\n",
    "    - [Logistic regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/logistic-regression)\n",
    "    - [Random forest](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/random-forest)\n",
    "    - Deep [neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks) (for example, [convolutional neural networks (CNN)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/convolutional-neural-networks) or [recurrent neural networks (RNN)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/recurrent-neural-networks))\n",
    "    - [Transformers](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model on a test dataset by using metrics such as:\n",
    "    - Accuracy\n",
    "    - Precision\n",
    "    - Recall\n",
    "    - F1-score\n",
    "\n",
    "    More information on these metrics can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/confusion-matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model deployment**: Deploying the trained model in a real-world application, such as an [API](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/api) or a spam filter. Deployment **isn’t** covered in this tutorial as it requires various considerations, such as model serving, application programming interface (API) design, scalability and security. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PyTorch? \n",
    "[PyTorch](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pytorch) is a software-based open source deep learning library used to build neural networks, combining the machine learning (ML) library of Torch with a [Python](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/python-vs-r)-based high-level API. PyTorch has a data type, the tensor, which serves as the fundamental unit of data used for computation. There are also PyTorch functions to operate on tensors incrementally and interactively.<sup>1</sup> However, the primary benefits that have established PyTorch as the top ML framework among academic and research communities are its ability to leverage [GPU](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu) for accelerated computation, ease of debugging and its ability to handle large datasets easily.<sup>1,2</sup>  Apart from these reasons, PyTorch is well suited for text classification particularly because of the large number of prebuilt functions and modules for common text classification tasks, such as embedding layers, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. Paired with PyTorch's dynamic computation graph, it stands out as the clear choice for our use case, providing a blend of flexibility and speed.<sup>3</sup>"

    "### Step 8. Evaluation\n",
    "Our final step is evaluation of our trained model. We want to know how well it performs, don’t we? For this step, the model is set to evaluation mode by using `model.eval()` and its performance is evaluated on the test set by using the `test_dl` data loader. Accuracy is calculated by comparing the model's predictions to the actual labels. The accuracy is then printed as a fraction of correct predictions out of the total number of test data samples, providing a measure of the model's performance on unseen data. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have successfully built and trained a SpamClassifier model by using PyTorch, which can classify text as spam or not spam. We started by preparing the dataset, creating a data loader and defining the model architecture. We then trained the model and evaluated its performance on the test dataset. By following this tutorial, you have gained hands-on experience with building and training a neural network model for text classification tasks. You can now apply this knowledge to build more complex models and tackle real-world problems in NLP."
