    "# Implement RAG chunking strategies with LangChain and watsonx.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Anna Gutowska\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will experiment with several chunking strategies using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and the latest IBM® [Granite™](https://www.ibm.com/granite) model now available on [watsonx.ai™](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai). The overall goal will be to perform chunking to effective implement [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is chunking? \n",
    "[Chunking](https://www.ibm.com/architectures/papers/rag-cookbook/chunking) refers to the process of breaking large pieces of text into smaller text segments or chunks. To emphasize the importance of chunking, it is helpful to understand RAG. RAG is a technique in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) that combines information retrieval and [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) to retrieve relevant information from supplemental datasets to optimize the quality of the LLM’s output. To manage large documents, we can use chunking to split the text into smaller snippets of meaningful chunks. These text chunks can then be embedded and stored in a [vector database](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-database) through the use of an [embedding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/embedding) model. Finally, the RAG system can then uses semantic search to retrieve only the most relevant chunks. Smaller chunks tend to outperform larger chunks as they tend to be more manageable pieces for models of smaller [context window](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/context-window) size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key components of chunking include: \n",
    "* Chunking strategy: Choosing the right chunking strategy for your RAG application is important as it determines the boundaries for setting chunks. We will explore some of these in the next section. \n",
    "* Chunk size: Maximum number of tokens to be in each chunk. Determining the appropriate chunk size usually involves some experimenting. \n",
    "* Chunk overlap: The number of tokens overlapping between chunks to preserve context. This is an optional parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the right chunking strategy for your RAG application\n",
    "There are several different chunking strategies to choose from. It is important to select the most effective chunking technique for the specific use case of your LLM application. Some commonly used chunking processes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fixed-size chunking**: Splitting text based on a chunk size and optional chunk overlap. This approach is most common and straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recursive chunking**: Iterating default separators until one of them produces the preferred chunk size. Default separators include `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`. This chunking method uses hierarchical separators so that paragraphs, followed by sentences and then words, are kept together as much as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic chunking**: Splitting text in a way that groups sentences based on the semantic similarity of their [embeddings](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/embedding). Embeddings of high semantic similarity are closer together than those of low semantic similarity. This results in context-aware chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document-based chunking**: Splitting based on document structure. This splitter can utilize Markdown text, images, tables and even Python code classes and functions as ways of determining structure. In doing so, large documents can be chunked and processed by the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agentic chunking**: Leverages [agentic AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) by allowing the LLM to determine appropriate document splitting based on semantic meaning as well as content structure such as paragraph types, section headings, step-by-step instructions and more. This chunker is experimental and attempts to simulate human reasoning when processing long documents."

IBM Granite 3.1 8B Instruct now bests most open models in its weight class in average scores on the academic benchmarks evaluations included in the Hugging Face OpenLLM Leaderboard.\\nThe evolution of the Granite model series has continued to prioritize excellence and efficiency in enterprise use cases, including agentic AI. This progress is most apparent in the newest 8B model’s significantly improved performance on IFEval, a dataset featuring tasks that test a model’s ability to follow detailed instructions, and Multi-step Soft Reasoning (MuSR), whose tasks measure reasoning and understanding on and of long texts.\\n\\r\\n        Expanded context length\\r\\n    \\nBolstering the performance leap from Granite 3.0 to Granite 3.1 is the expansion of all models’ context windows. Granite 3.1’s 128K token context length is on par with that of other leading open model series, including Llama 3.1–3.3 and Qwen2.5.\\nThe context window (or context length) of a large language model (LLM) is the amount of text, in tokens, that an LLM can consider at any one time. A larger context window enables a model to process larger inputs, carry out longer continuous exchanges and incorporate more information into each output. Tokenization doesn’t entail any fixed token-to-word “exchange rate,” but 1.5 tokens per word is a useful estimate. 128K tokens is roughly equivalent to a 300-page book.\\nAbove a threshold of about 100K tokens, impressive new possibilities emerge, including multi-document question answering, repository-level code understanding, self-reflection and LLM-powered autonomous agents.1 Granite 3.1’s expanded context length thus lends itself to a much wider range of enterprise use cases, from processing code bases and lengthy legal documents in their entirety to simultaneously reviewing thousands of financial transactions.\\n\\r\\n        Granite Guardian 3.1: detecting hallucinations in agentic workflows\\nGranite Guardian 3.1 8B and Granite Guardian 3.1 2B can now detect hallucinations that might occur in an agentic workflow, affording the same accountability and trust to function calling that we already provide for RAG.\\nMany steps and subprocesses occur in the space between the initial request sent to an AI agent and the output the agent eventually returns to the user. To provide oversight throughout, Granite Guardian 3.1 models monitor every function call for syntactic and semantic hallucinations.\\nFor instance, if an AI agent purportedly queries an external information source, Granite Guardian 3.1 monitors for fabricated information flows. If an agentic workflow entails intermediate calculations using figures retrieved from a bank record, Granite Guardian 3.1 checks to see whether the agent pulled the correct function call along with the appropriate numbers.\\nToday’s release is yet another step toward accountability and trust for any component of an LLM-based enterprise workflow. The new Granite Guardian 3.1 models are available on Hugging Face. They’ll also be available through Ollama later this month and on IBM watsonx.ai in January 2025.\\n\\r\\n        Granite embedding models\\r\\n    \\nEmbeddings are an integral part of the LLM ecosystem. An accurate and efficient means of representing words, queries and documents in numerical form is essential to an array of enterprise tasks including semantic search, vector search and RAG, as well as maintaining effective vector databases. An effective embedding model can significantly enhance a system’s understanding of user intent and increase the relevance of information and sources in response to a query.\\nWhile the past two years have seen the proliferation of increasingly competitive open source autoregressive LLMs for tasks like text generation and summarization, open source embedding model releases from major providers are relatively few and far between.\\nThe new Granite Embedding models are an enhanced evolution of the Slate family of encoder-only, RoBERTA-based language models. Trained with the same care and consideration for filtering bias, hate, abuse and profanity (“HAP”) as the rest of the Granite series, Granite Embedding is offered in four model sizes, two of which support multilingual embedding across 12 natural languages:\\nGranite-Embedding-30M-EnglishGranite-Embedding-125M-EnglishGranite-Embedding-107M-MultilingualGranite-Embedding-278M-Multilingual')"

This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 500B tokens. Moreover, Granite 3.1 instruction models provide an improved developer experience for function-calling and RAG generation tasks.\\n\\nGranite 3.1 models come in 4 varying sizes and 2 architectures:\\n- Dense Models: 2B and 8B parameter models, trained on 12 trillion tokens in total.\\n- Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) Models: Sparse 1B and 3B MoE models, with 400M and 800M activated parameters respectively, trained on 10 trillion tokens in total.\\n\\nAccordingly, these options provide a range of models with different compute requirements to choose from, with appropriate trade-offs with their performance on downstream tasks. At each scale, we release base model â€” checkpoints of models after pretraining, as well as instruct checkpoints â€” models finetuned for dialogue, instruction-following, helpfulness, and safety.\\n\\nEvaluation results show that Granite-3.1-8B-Instruct outperforms models of similar parameter sizes in [Hugging Face\\'s OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/) (see Figure 1). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Figure 1.

Using the Granite 3.1 model, we successfully produced appropriate model responses to a user query related to the documents provided as context.
