    "In this tutorial, we’ll use LangChain to walk through a step-by-step simple Retrieval Augmented Generation ([RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG)) example in Python. RAG is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that combines information retrieval and generative models to produce more accurate, relevant and contextually aware responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our use case, we’ll set up a RAG system for various IBM webpages related to the company's technology, products and offerings. The fetched content from these ibm.com websites will make up our knowledge base. From this knowledge base, we will then provide context to an LLM so it can answer some questions about IBM products. \n",
    "\n",
    "# More about RAG and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional language generation tasks, [large language models](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or [IBM’s Granite Models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) are used to construct responses based on an input prompt. However, these models may struggle to produce responses that are contextually relevant, factually accurate or up to date. The models may not know the latest information on IBM products. To tackle this knowledge gap, we can use methods such as [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/fine-tuning) or continued pre-training, but both can be expensive. Instead, we can use RAG to leverage a knowledge base of existing content. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAG applications address the knowledge gap limitation by incorporating a retrieval step before response generation. During retrieval, [vector search](https://www.ibm.com/topics/vector-search) can be used to identify contextually pertinent information, such as relevant information or documents from a large corpus of text, typically stored in a [vector database](https://www.ibm.com/topics/vector-database). Finally, an LLM is used to generate a response based on the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a powerful, open-source framework that facilitates the development of applications using LLMs for various NLP tasks. In the context of RAG, LangChain plays a critical role by combining the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models to enhance the capabilities of NLP systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?context=wx&apps=all) using your IBM Cloud account.\n",

    "\n",
    "\tYou can get your project ID from within your project. Click the **Manage** tab. Then, copy the project ID from the **Details** section of the **General** page. You need this ID for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=editor-creating-managing-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "This step will open a Notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial.  Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset.

    "In this tutorial, you created a simple LangChain RAG workflow in Python with watsonx. You fetched 25 articles from ibm.com to create a vector store as context for an LLM to answer questions about IBM offerings and technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine a situation where we can create chatbots to field these questions.\n",
