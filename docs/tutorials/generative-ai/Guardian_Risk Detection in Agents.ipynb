    "### The Need for Evaluating LLM Agents for Risk and Reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the evolution of LLMs into agentic systems that can chain actions, use tools, and maintain context, their production is no longer simple text, but rather decisions. In this new paradigm, it is not sufficient to evaluate agents on a purely linguistic level. Rather, we need to consider them as complex, probabilistic systems acting on dynamic inputs in external contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, this involves observability for non-deterministic failure modes, such as ungrounded generation, leakage, or drift in reasoning. These failure modes emerge almost always in long-form interaction or edge case prompts, and are often missed by static evaluation and unit tests. It follows that we need runtime, behavior-level evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk-aware evaluation frameworks, such as Granite Guardian, provide observability layers for continuous scoring along behavior dimensions such as factuality, safety, relevance and compliance. This is valuable for responsible and ethical AI development, and it also provides a validation layer for performance and governance before deployment in real-world, enterprise-grade applications."

    "### Key Risk Categories in Autonomous AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "As agents no longer operate in closed-loop systems; they interact with dynamic environments, real-time inputs, external APIs, and human users introducing  a unique set of risk categories that must be systematically addressed to ensure reliability, safety, and responsible deployment. To truly ensure accountability and oversight, we need to look at the risks agents face from both sides—the inputs they take in and the outputs they produce. By viewing risks through this full picture, we can better spot potential issues early and address them before they lead to bigger problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the key risk metrics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Harm: Content considered universally harmful. This is the general category, which encompasses a variety of risks including those not specifically addressed by the other categories.\n",
    "2. Social Bias: Systemic prejudice against groups based on shared identity or characteristics, often stemming from stereotypes or cultural influences. This can manifest in thoughts, attitudes, or behaviors that unfairly favor or disfavor certain groups over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Violence: Promoting or describing physical harm to individuals or groups. This includes depictions of assault, self-harm, or creation of a hostile environment through threats or intimidation.\n",
    "4. Groundedness:  evaluates how well the agent’s response aligns with trusted source content, ensuring factual accuracy and minimizing hallucinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Personal Information: measures the likelihood that a prompt or agent response contains personally identifiable information that could compromise user privacy. \n",

    "Granite Guardian is a open source suite of safeguards designed to provide risk detection for prompts and responses, enabling safe and responsible use in combination with any large language model (LLM) and applications. Trained on a mix of human-annotated, synthetic, and adversarial datasets, Granite Guardian offers multi-label classification with verbalized confidence levels. It is available in various sizes (2B to 8B), enabling scalable, real-time safety checks for enterprise AI systems, promoting responsible and secure deployment of autonomous agents and generative applications.

    "### Conclusion \n",
    "As LLM agents evolve into more autonomous roles—reasoning, making decisions, and interacting with users—it is essential for us to evaluate their behavior in a manner that maximizes safety, reliability, and enterprise compliance.Granite Guardian provides an industry-leading framework for evaluating both user prompts and agent responses across key risk dimensions including:\n",
    "1. Toxicity, bias, and unsafe content\n",
    "2. Hallucination and factual inaccuracy\n",
    "3. PII exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing Granite Guardian into your agent pipeline, you receive actionable insights via quantitative metrics including risk probability scores, groundedness, and factual reliability. These metrics provide you with ways to:\n",
    " a. Identify and remediate risky outputs earlier\n",
    " b. Support agent reliability through feedback loops.\n",
    " c. Demonstrate compliance with regulatory and ethical frameworks in production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, Granite Guardian allows you to step away from experimentation and work towards deploying trustworthy LLM agents at scale—based on evidence, control, and accountability.\n"
