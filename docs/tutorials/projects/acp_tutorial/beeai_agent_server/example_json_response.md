Some listeners might find the technical jargon off-putting or the lyrics too abstract.', 'market_comparison': "Reminiscent of bands like Daft Punk and Coldplay, with a touch of CHVRCHES' synth-pop style.", 'recommendation': 'Sign, but with a suggestion to refine the lyrics to make them more relatable and accessible to a wider audience.'}
