    "This notebook serves as a practical guide to implementing automatic tool calling with Large Language Models (LLMs) like the Granite-3 series in LM Studio. While LLMs excel at understanding and generating human-like text, they often face limitations when tasks require precise computation, access to real-time external data, or the execution of specific, well-defined procedures. By equipping LLMs with a set of \"tools\"—essentially external functions they can choose to call—we can significantly extend their capabilities. This tutorial will demonstrate how to define these tools and integrate them, enabling the LLM to perform a wider range of tasks with greater reliability."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how integrating tools can enhance the utility and agentic capability of LLMs. We illustrated that by providing an LLM with access to predefined external functions, it can transcend its core language processing capabilities to perform tasks like accurate calculations or interface with external systems, which it cannot do reliably on its own. The key takeaway is that tool-use empowers LLMs to delegate specific sub-problems to specialized routines, allowing them to ground their responses in factual data or precise operations. This approach not only improves accuracy but also enables LLMs to engage in more complex, interactive workflows, effectively transforming them into more versatile and powerful assistants."
