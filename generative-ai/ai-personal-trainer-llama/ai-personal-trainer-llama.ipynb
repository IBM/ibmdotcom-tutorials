    "In this tutorial, you will build a generative AI-powered personal trainer. This AI trainer leverages the latest opensource [Meta Llama 4 Scout](https://www.llama.com/) [large language model (LLM)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) for processing image input and generating personalized workout plans to reach your fitness goals effectively. We will access the model through the [IBM watsonx.ai™](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) API. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Are you looking to be more active? Has your fitness journey reached a plateau and are you looking to take your workout routines to the next level? In this tutorial, you will use [AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence) to provide a personalized training experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "## AI fitness: How it works\n",
    "Our workout app is composed of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user uploads images of their current workout equipment, one item at a time. This set can consist of both home & gym equipment. \n",
    "2. The user selects the following criteria:   \n",
    "    * Workout type: strength, endurance, flexibility, balance, cardio and so on.\n",
    "    * Workout length: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours and so on.\n",
    "    * Fitness level: beginner, intermediate or advanced. \n",
    "3. Upon submission of the input, the multimodal Llama 4 Scout model iterates over the list of images and returns the following output:\n",
    "    * Description of the item: either “equipment” or “other.”\n",
    "    * Category: \"barbell\", \"dumbbell\", \"machine\", \"bodyweight\" and so on.\n",
    "    * Workout type: \"strength\", \"endurance\", \"flexibility\", \"balance\", \"cardio\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The same Llama 4 model then serves as a fitness coach. The LLM uses the previous output to provide a training plan that is suitable for the user’s selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The training program and the images in the described personalized recommendation are all returned to the user."

    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You need an [IBM Cloud® account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) to create a [watsonx.ai™](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the watsonx® [application programming interface (API)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/api), you will need to complete the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?context=wx&apps=all) by using your IBM Cloud account.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Set up watsonx.ai Runtime service and API key\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [watsonx.ai Runtime](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watsonxai-runtime) service instance (choose the Lite plan, which is a free instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate an [API Key](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-authentication.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Associate the watsonx.ai Runtime service to the project that you created in [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/assoc-services.html?context=cpdaas). "

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you built a fitness app that uses an AI coach to customize and automate training sessions for new clients. This coaching platform and other advancements alike have the potential to reshape the fitness industry by providing real-time feedback to a real person looking for online training. Using photos or screenshots of the user's equipment, workout plans are customized by the AI tool to meet the specified criteria. Workouts for weight loss, muscle gain and strength training are all possible outputs. The Llama 4 model was critical for labeling and categorizing each item as well as generating the workout plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some next steps for building off this application can include:\n",
    "- Creating a frontend to allow for AI chatbot functionality, similar to ChatGPT.\n",
    "- Building an app for users to use the AI personal trainer on-the-go. This might be an iOS app for iPhone users, for example.\n",
    "- Redesigning the use case to meet demand for other services such as mental health support. "
