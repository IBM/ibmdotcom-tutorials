    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Vertical AI Architectures\n",
    "- **Structure**:  \n",
    "  - **Leader-Agent Model**: A designated leader agent oversees the system by assigning tasks to subordinate agents, managing their workflow, and ensuring that objectives are met efficiently. This structure mirrors a traditional hierarchical organization, where the leader sets priorities and strategies.  \n",
    "  - Subordinate agents report back to the leader with their progress or results. The leader integrates these results, monitors overall progress, resolves conflicts, and makes high-level decisions to keep the system on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:  \n",
    "  - **Hierarchy**: Tasks are divided among agents based on their specific roles, expertise, and capabilities. This structured distribution ensures that each agent focuses on a defined part of the overall objective, with the leader coordinating and aligning their efforts.  \n",
    "  - **Centralized Communication**: Subordinate agents primarily interact with the leader, who serves as the central hub for information flow. This structure minimizes inter-agent communication, which simplifies coordination but may reduce creative collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**:  \n",
    "  - **Clear Task Division**: Roles and responsibilities are explicitly defined, ensuring that agents focus on their designated tasks without overlapping efforts. This clarity reduces confusion and promotes efficiency.  \n",
    "  - **Centralized Control**: The leader acts as a single point of accountability, maintaining a unified direction and ensuring that the system remains aligned with its overall goals.  \n",
    "  - **Better for Sequential Tasks**: This architecture is particularly effective for tasks that must be completed in a specific order, as the leader ensures proper task sequencing and manages dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weaknesses**:  \n",
    "  - **Bottlenecks**: When too many agents depend on the leader for instructions, updates, or feedback, the leader can become a bottleneck, slowing the entire system.  \n",
    "  - **Single Point of Failure**: If the leader malfunctions, makes an incorrect decision, or becomes unavailable, the entire system may fail or deviate from its objectives.  \n",
    "  - **Limited Collaboration**: Subordinate agents are restricted to communicating with the leader, limiting opportunities for direct collaboration between agents. This can result in missed creative problem-solving or innovative solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best Use Cases**:  \n",
    "  - **Document Generation**: Tasks like creating a large document can be divided into distinct sections, with each section assigned to a different agent and overseen by the leader to ensure consistency and integration.  \n",
    "  - **Workflow Automation**: This architecture is well-suited for automated processes where task dependencies must be closely monitored and managed, such as assembly-line workflows or multi-step approval processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Horizontal AI Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure**:  \n",

This structure fosters a decentralized approach, allowing agents to take initiative and contribute equally to problem-solving and decision-making without relying on a single controlling entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:  \n",
    "  - **Distributed Collaboration**: Every agent has access to the same pool of information and resources, enabling them to interact and exchange insights with one another. This creates an open environment where knowledge and efforts are shared to maximize creativity and efficiency.  \n",
    "  - **Group Decision-Making**: Agents engage in collective planning, discussions, and problem-solving as peers. By pooling diverse perspectives and expertise, the system can reach decisions that are well-rounded and informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**:  \n",
    "  - **Dynamic Problem-Solving**: Encourages creative and diverse approaches, as agents are free to contribute unique ideas and solutions. This flexibility often leads to innovative problem-solving strategies.  \n",
    "  - **Reduced Bottlenecks**: Since there is no central leader, decisions and progress are not reliant on a single point of control. This reduces delays and increases system resilience.  \n",
    "  - **Parallel Execution**: Particularly effective for tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent subtasks, allowing multiple agents to work simultaneously and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weaknesses**:  \n",
    "  - **Risk of Inefficiency**: Without a designated leader, agents may spend excessive time discussing and deliberating, leading to unproductive interactions and slower decision-making.  \n",
    "  - **Coordination Challenges**: In a shared environment, mismanagement of resources or overlapping efforts can result in conflicts, redundancies, or wasted time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best Use Cases**:  \n",
    "  - **Brainstorming or Consulting**: Ideal for generating ideas or exploring various solutions to a problem, where diversity of thought is crucial.  \n",

    "  - `max_new_tokens`: Sets the maximum number of tokens the model can generate in a single request (500 tokens in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Parameters for Verification**:  \n",
    "  The `parameters` dictionary is printed to the console to verify that the configuration has been correctly set.\n",

    "- **Initialize the Search Tool**:  \n",
    "  The `SerperDevTool` is initialized and stored in the variable `search`. This tool will be used by the agents to query external data sources, such as the internet, during their tasks. A message confirming the initialization is printed.\n",

    "  The model `watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-1-70b-instruct` is specified as the primary model. This model will be used by the agents to process tasks. The `\"watsonx\"` prefix helps Crew (the agent orchestration tool) load the appropriate handler for the LLM.\n",

    "- **Initialize the Watsonx LLM**:  \n",
    "  The `watsonx_llm` is initialized using the provided credentials (API key, URL, and project ID). This model will be used by agents for tasks requiring natural language processing. A confirmation message is printed once initialization is successful.\n",
