    "# Use role prompting with IBM watsonx and Granite \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will follow step-by-step instructions to perform a prompt engineering technique called role prompting. We will use an IBM Granite Model to assign personas for nuanced model outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is role prompting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Role prompting is a prompt engineering technique that instructs an artificial intelligence (AI) model to take on a specific role or persona when generating a response. This technique can be used to guide the model's tone, style and behavior, which can lead to more engaging outputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is about optimizing the model input, so it responds with appropriate, meaningful answers. [Zero-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/tutorials/zero-shot-classification) and [few-shot prompting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-prompting) are two popular techniques used to converse with LLMs. LLMs have a natural ability to perform  natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to their ability to process and interpret human language. The language capabilities of AI models are valuable for tasks ranging from chatbot conversations and [multiagent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system) interactions to open-ended creative writing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI gets more personal when a large language model ([LLM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models)) is instructed to act as a specific persona to fulfill a role’s specific needs. The AI’s responses can be more accurate and relevant when first prompted with an assigned role. AI models leverage huge datasets so an assigned role can be anything from a teacher, historical figure, salesperson and so on, bound only by what one's imagination can think of. This ability is what makes role prompting, also referred to as *persona* prompting, such a powerful technique. An AI model’s adaptability makes it a master of disguise, able to generate responses tailored to a user or system’s specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How role prompting is used  \n",
    "\n",
    "Role prompting can be used to give a chatbot a persona to better interact with users or an AI agent to better interact with other agents. If you’re familiar with prompt templates, you may have already seen role prompting in action. For example, many agentic frameworks use role-playing agents to complete tasks and collaborate effectively. [ChatDev](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatdev) uses a role prompting technique called a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism clearly defines the agent’s role which acts as a guideline for its generated outputs."

Next, we compared the output of a non-role prompted model versus a role prompted model for chatbot responses. We concluded by addressing that the response provided by role prompting is more nuanced and supportive in its language, providing elevated customer care. "
