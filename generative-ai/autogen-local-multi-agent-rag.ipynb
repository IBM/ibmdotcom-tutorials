    "# Multi-agent RAG with AutoGen: Build locally with Granite\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors:** Kelly Abuelsaad, Anna Gutowska\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you build [agentic workflows](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-workflows) without needing extremely large, costly [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-model)? The answer is yes. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to build a multi-agent RAG system locally with AutoGen by using IBM® [Granite™](https://www.ibm.com/granite). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Agentic RAG overview\n",
    "[Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation) is an effective way of providing an LLM with additional datasets from various data sources without the need for expensive fine-tuning. Similarly, [agentic RAG](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-rag) leverages an [AI agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents)’s ability to plan and execute subtasks along with the retrieval of relevant information to supplement an LLM's knowledge base. This ability allows for the optimization and greater scalability of RAG applications compared to traditional [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbots). No longer do we need to write complex SQL queries to extract relevant data from a knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "The future of agentic RAG is multi-agent RAG, where several specialized agents [collaborate](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multi-agent-collaboration) to achieve optimal latency and efficiency. We will demonstrate this collaboration by using a small, efficient model such as Granite 3.2 and combining it with a modular agent architecture. We will use multiple specialized \"mini agents\" that collaborate to achieve tasks through adaptive planning and tool or function calling. Like humans, a team of agents, or a [multi-agent system](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system), often outperforms the heroic efforts of an individual, especially when they have clearly defined roles and effective [communication](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agent-communication).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the [orchestration](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agent-orchestration) of this collaboration, we can use AutoGen (AG2) as the core [framework](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/top-ai-agent-frameworks) to manage workflows and decision-making, alongside other tools like Ollama for local LLM serving and Open WebUI for interaction. AutoGen is a framework for creating multi-agent AI applications developed by Microsoft.1 Notably, every one of the components leveraged in this tutorial is open source. Notably, every component leveraged in this tutorial is [open source](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/open-source). Together, these tools enable you to build an AI system that is both powerful and privacy-conscious, without leaving your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-agent architecture: When collaboration beats competition\n",
    "Our Granite retrieval agent relies on a modular architecture in which each agent has a specialized role. Like humans, agents perform best when they have targeted instructions and just enough context to make an informed decision. Too much extraneous information, such as an unfiltered chat history, can create a “needle in the haystack” problem, where it becomes increasingly difficult to decipher signal from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this [agentic AI architecture](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-architecture), the agents work together sequentially to achieve the goal. Here is how the generative AI system is organized:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planner agent**: Creates the initial high-level plan, once in the beginning of the workflow. For example, if a user asks, “What are comparable open source projects to the ones my team is using?” then, the agent will put together a step-by-step plan that might look something like this: “1. Search team documents for open source technologies. 2. Search the web for similar open source projects to the ones found in step 1.” If any of these steps fail or provide insufficient results, the steps can be later adapted by the reflection agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Aasistant**: The research assistant is the workhorse of the system. It takes in and executes instructions such as “Search team documents for open source technologies.” For step 1 of the plan, it uses the initial instruction from the planner agent. For subsequent steps, it also receives curated context from the outcomes of previous steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if asked to “Search the web for similar open source projects,” it will also receive the output from the previous document search step. Depending on the instruction, the research assistant can use tools like web search or document search, or both, to fulfill its task. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step critic**: The step critic is responsible for deciding whether the output of the previous step satisfactorily fulfilled the instruction it was given. It receives two pieces of information: the single-step instruction that was just executed and the output of that instruction. Having a step critic weigh in on the conversation brings clarity around whether the goal was achieved, which is needed for the planning of the next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal judge**: The goal judge determines whether the ultimate objective has been met, based on all of the requirements of the provided goal, the plans drafted to achieve it, and the information gathered so far. The output of the judge is either \"YES\" or \"NOT YET\" followed by a brief explanation that is no longer than one or two sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection agent**: The reflection agent is our executive decision-maker. It decides what step to take next, whether that is encroaching onto the next planned step, pivoting course to make up for mishaps or confirming that the goal has been completed. Like a real-life CEO, it performs its best decision-making when it has a clear goal in mind and is presented with concise findings on the progress that has or has not been made to reach that goal. The output of the reflection agent is either the next step to take or the instructions to terminate if the goal has been reached. We present the reflection agent with the following items:\n",
    "- The goal\n",
    "- The original plan\n",
    "- The last step that was executed\n",
    "- The result of the last step indicating success or failure\n",
    "- A concise sequence of previously executed instructions (just the instructions, not their output)\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting these items in a structured format makes it clear to our decision maker what has been done so that it can decide what needs to happen next. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Report Generator**: Once the goal is achieved, the Report Generator synthesizes all findings into a cohesive output that directly answers the original query. While each step in the process generates targeted outputs, the Report Generator ties everything together into a final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leveraging open source tools\n",
    "For beginners, it can be difficult to build an agentic AI application from scratch. Hence, we will use a set of open source tools. The Granite Retrieval Agent integrates multiple tools for agentic RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open WebUI**: The user interacts with the system through an intuitive chat interface hosted in Open WebUI. This interface acts as the primary point for submitting queries (such as “Fetch me the latest news articles pertaining to my project notes”) and viewing the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python-based agent (AG2 framework)**: At the core of the system is a Python-based agent built by using AutoGen (AG2). This agent coordinates the workflow by breaking down tasks and dynamically calling tools to execute steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent has access to two primary tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document search tool: Fetches relevant information from a vector database containing uploaded project notes or documents stored as embeddings. This vector search leverages the built-in documental retrieval APIs inside Open WebUI, rather than setting up an entirely separate data store.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web search tool: Performs web-based searches to gather external knowledge and real-time information. In this case, we are using SearXNG as our metasearch engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ollama**: The IBM Granite 3.2 LLM serves as the language model powering the system. It is hosted locally by using Ollama, ensuring fast inference, cost efficiency and data privacy. If you are interested in running this project with larger models, API access through IBM [watsonx.ai®](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) or OpenAI, for example, is preferred. This approach, however, requires a watsonx.ai or OpenAI API key. Instead, we use locally hosted Ollama in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common open source, agent frameworks not covered in this tutorial include [LangChain](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langchain), [LangGraph](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph) and [crewAI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "Detailed setup instructions as well as the entire project can be viewed on the [IBM Granite Community GitHub](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-retrieval-agent). The Jupyter Notebook version of this tutorial can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/ibmdotcom-tutorials) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps provide a quick setup for the Granite Retrieval agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Ollama\n",
    "Installing Ollama is as simple as downloading the client from the [official Ollama site](https://ollama.com/). After installing Ollama, run the following command to pull the Granite 3.2 LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ollama pull granite3.2:8b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now up and running with Ollama and Granite."

If you are upgrading from AutoGen v0.2, please refer to the [Migration Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/migration-guide.html) for detailed instructions on how to update your code and configurations.\\n\\n```bash\\n# Install AutoGen Studio for no-code GUI\\npip install -U \"autogenstudio\"\\n```\\n\\n## Quickstart\\n\\n### Hello World\\n\\nCreate an assistant agent using OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o model. See [other supported models](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/tutorial/models.html).\\n\\n```python\\nimport asyncio\\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent\\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\\n\\nasync def main() -> None:\\n    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\")\\n    agent = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", model_client=model_client)\\n    print(await agent.run(task=\"Say \\'Hello World!\\'\"))\\n    await model_client.close()\\n\\nasyncio.run(main())\\n```\\n\\n### Web Browsing Agent Team\\n\\nCreate a group chat team with a web surfer agent and a user proxy agent\\nfor web browsing tasks. You need to install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library).\\n\\n```python\\n# pip install -U autogen-agentchat autogen-ext[openai,web-surfer]\\n# playwright install\\nimport asyncio\\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import UserProxyAgent\\nfrom autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMentionTermination\\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat\\nfrom autogen_agentchat.ui import Console\\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\\nfrom autogen_ext.agents.web_surfer import MultimodalWebSurfer\\n\\nasync def main() -> None:\\n    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\")\\n    # The web surfer will open a Chromium browser window to perform web browsing tasks.\\n    web_surfer = MultimodalWebSurfer(\"web_surfer\", model_client, headless=False, animate_actions=True)\\n    # The user proxy agent is used to get user input after each step of the web surfer.\\n    # NOTE: you can skip input by pressing Enter.\\n    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\")\\n    # The termination condition is set to end the conversation when the user types \\'exit\\'.\\n    termination = TextMentionTermination(\"exit\", sources=[\"user_proxy\"])\\n    # Web surfer and user proxy take turns in a round-robin fashion.\\n    team = RoundRobinGroupChat([web_surfer, user_proxy], termination_condition=termination)\\n    try:\\n        # Start the team and wait for it to terminate.\\n        await Console(team.run_stream(task=\"Find information about AutoGen and write a short summary.\"))\\n    finally:\\n        await web_surfer.close()\\n        await model_client.close()\\n\\nasyncio.run(main())\\n```\\n\\n### AutoGen Studio\\n\\nUse AutoGen Studio to prototype and run multi-agent workflows without writing code.\\n\\n```bash\\n# Run AutoGen Studio on http://localhost:8080\\nautogenstudio ui --port 8080 --appdir ./my-app\\n```\\n\\n## Why Use AutoGen?\\n\\n<div align=\"center\">\\n  <img src=\"autogen-landing.jpg\" alt=\"AutoGen Landing\" width=\"500\">\\n</div>\\n\\nThe AutoGen ecosystem provides everything you need to create AI agents, especially multi-agent workflows -- framework, developer tools, and applications.\\n\\nThe _framework_ uses a layered and extensible design. Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.\\n\\n- [Core API](./python/packages/autogen-core/) implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also support cross-language support for .NET and Python.\\n- [AgentChat API](./python/packages/autogen-agentchat/) implements a simpler but opinionated\\xa0API for rapid prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and is closest to what users of v0.2 are familiar with and supports common multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.\\n- [Extensions API](./python/packages/autogen-ext/) enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It support specific implementation of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.\\n\\nThe ecosystem also supports two essential _developer tools_:\\n\\n<div align=\"center\">\\n  <img src=\"https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/microsoft/autogen/refs/heads/main/python/packages/autogen-studio/docs/ags_screen.png\" alt=\"AutoGen Studio Screenshot\" width=\"500\">\\n</div>\\n\\n- [AutoGen Studio](./python/packages/autogen-studio/) provides a no-code GUI for building multi-agent applications.\\n- [AutoGen Bench](./python/packages/agbench/) provides a benchmarking suite for evaluating agent performance.\\n\\nYou can use the AutoGen framework and developer tools to create applications for your domain. For example, [Magentic-One](./python/packages/magentic-one-cli/) is a state-of-the-art multi-agent team built using AgentChat API and Extensions API that can handle a variety of tasks that require web browsing, code execution, and file handling.\\n\\nWith AutoGen you get to join and contribute to a thriving ecosystem. We host weekly office hours and talks with maintainers and community. We also have a [Discord server](https://aka.ms/autogen-discord) for real-time chat, GitHub Discussions for Q&A, and a blog for tutorials and updates.\\n\\n## Where to go next?\\n\\n<div

    "A multi-agent setup enables the creation of practical, usable tools by getting the most out of moderately sized, open source models like Granite 3.2. This agentic RAG architecture, built with fully open source tools, can serve as a launching point to design and customize your question answering agents and AI algorithms. It can also be used outside of the box for a wide array of use cases. In this tutorial, you had the opportunity to delve into simple and complex agentic systems, leveraging the capabilities of AutoGen. The Granite LLM was invoked by using Ollama, allowing for a fully local exploration of these systems. As a next step, consider integrating more custom tools into your agentic system."
