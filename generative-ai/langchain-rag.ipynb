    "In this tutorial, we’ll use LangChain to walk through a step-by-step simple Retrieval Augmented Generation ([RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG)) example in Python. RAG is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that combines information retrieval and generative models to produce more accurate, relevant and contextually aware responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our use case, we’ll set up a RAG system for various IBM webpages related to the company's technology, products and offerings. The fetched content from these ibm.com websites will make up our knowledge base. From this knowledge base, we will then provide context to an LLM so it can answer some questions about IBM products. \n",
    "\n",
    "# More about RAG and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional language generation tasks, [large language models](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or [IBM’s Granite Models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) are used to construct responses based on an input prompt. However, these models may struggle to produce responses that are contextually relevant, factually accurate or up to date. The models may not know the latest information on IBM products. To tackle this knowledge gap, we can use methods such as [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/fine-tuning) or continued pre-training, but both can be expensive. Instead, we can use RAG to leverage a knowledge base of existing content. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAG applications address the knowledge gap limitation by incorporating a retrieval step before response generation. During retrieval, [vector search](https://www.ibm.com/topics/vector-search) can be used to identify contextually pertinent information, such as relevant information or documents from a large corpus of text, typically stored in a [vector database](https://www.ibm.com/topics/vector-database). Finally, an LLM is used to generate a response based on the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a powerful, open-source framework that facilitates the development of applications using LLMs for various NLP tasks. In the context of RAG, LangChain plays a critical role by combining the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models to enhance the capabilities of NLP systems."

    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?context=wx&apps=all) using your IBM Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a [watsonx.ai project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=projects-creating-project).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tYou can get your project ID from within your project. Click the **Manage** tab. Then, copy the project ID from the **Details** section of the **General** page. You need this ID for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=editor-creating-managing-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "This step will open a Notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial.  Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset. To view more Granite tutorials, check out the [IBM Granite Community](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community). This tutorial is also available on [Github](https://github.com/IBM/ibmdotcom-tutorials/tree/main/generative-ai/langchain-rag.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Set up a Watson Machine Learning (WML) service instance and API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) service instance (select your appropriate region and choose the Lite plan, which is a free instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate an [API Key in WML](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-authentication.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Associate the WML service to the project that you created in [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/assoc-services.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Install and import relevant libraries and set up credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a few dependencies for this tutorial. Make sure to import the libraries below, and if they're not installed, you can resolve this with a quick pip install."

IBM watsonx AI and data platform have an end-to-end process for building and testing foundation models and generative AI. For IBM-developed models, we search for and remove duplication, and we employ URL blocklists, filters for objectionable content and document quality, sentence splitting and tokenization techniques, all before model training.\\nDuring the data training process, we work to prevent misalignments in the model outputs and use supervised fine-tuning to enable better instruction following so that the model can be used to complete enterprise tasks via prompt engineering. We are continuing to develop the Granite models in several directions, including other modalities, industry-specific content and more data annotations for training, while also deploying regular, ongoing data protection safeguards for IBM developed models.\\xa0\\nGiven the rapidly changing generative AI technology landscape, our end-to-end processes are expected to continuously evolve and improve.\\xa0As a testament to the rigor IBM puts into the development and testing of its foundation models, the company provides its standard contractual intellectual property indemnification for IBM-developed models, similar to those it provides for IBM hardware and software products.\\nMoreover, contrary to some other providers of large language models and consistent with the IBM standard approach on indemnification, IBM does not require its customers to indemnify IBM for a customer's use of IBM-developed models. Also, consistent with the IBM approach to its indemnification obligation, IBM does not cap its indemnification liability for the IBM-developed models.\\nThe current watsonx models now under these protections include:\\n(1) Slate family of encoder-only models.\\n(2) Granite family of a decoder-only model.\\nLearn more about licensing for Granite models\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\n\\n1Performance of Granite models conducted by IBM Research against leading open models across both academic and enterprise benchmarks - https://ibm.com/new/ibm-granite-3-0-open-state-of-the-art-enterprise-models\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\""

Next steps Try Granite Read Granite documentation Read the IBM statement on IP protection IBM believes in the creation, deployment and utilization of AI models that advance innovation across the enterprise responsibly. IBM watsonx AI and data platform have an end-to-end process for building and testing foundation models and generative AI. For IBM-developed models, we search for and remove duplication, and we employ URL blocklists, filters for objectionable content and document quality, sentence splitting and tokenization techniques, all before model training. During the data training process, we work to prevent misalignments in the model outputs and use supervised fine-tuning to enable better instruction following so that the model can be used to complete enterprise tasks via prompt engineering. We are continuing to develop the Granite models in several directions, including other modalities, industry-specific content and more data annotations for training, while also deploying regular, ongoing data protection safeguards for IBM developed models. Given the rapidly changing generative AI technology landscape, our end-to-end processes are expected to continuously evolve and improve. As a testament to the rigor IBM puts into the development and testing of its foundation models, the company provides its standard contractual intellectual property indemnification for IBM-developed models, similar to those it provides for IBM hardware and software products. Moreover, contrary to some other providers of large language models and consistent with the IBM standard approach on indemnification, IBM does not require its customers to indemnify IBM for a customer's use of IBM-developed models. Also, consistent with the IBM approach to its indemnification obligation, IBM does not cap its indemnification liability for the IBM-developed models. The current watsonx models now under these protections include: (1) Slate family of encoder-only models. (2) Granite family of a decoder-only model.
