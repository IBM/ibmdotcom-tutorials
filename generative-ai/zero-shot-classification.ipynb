    "# Perform zero-shot classification with a foundation model  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use an IBM Granite (TM) model to perform zero-shot classification.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## What is zero-shot classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot classification uses zero-shot prompting, a prompt engineering technique that allows a model to perform a task without any specific training or examples. This is an application of zero-shot learning ([ZSL](https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-shot-learning)) which is a machine learning method that relies on the pre-trained models’ ability to recognize and categorize objects or concepts on post-training. ZSL is similar to few-shot learning ([FSL](https://www.ibm.com/topics/few-shot-learning)), the ability for a model to make an accurate prediction by training on a small number of labeled examples. Both techniques are used to enable models to perform tasks that they haven’t been explicitly trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have been experimenting with machine learning models for classification tasks since the 50’s. [The Perceptron](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse490h1/19wi/exhibit/machine-learning-1.html#:~:text=Finally%2C%20the%20first%20neural%20network,(History%20of%20the%20Perceptron)) is an early classification model that uses a decision-boundary to classify data into different groups. Most ML/DL [methods](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359103439_A_Zero-Shot_Learning_Approach_to_Classifying_Requirements_A_Preliminary_Study) rely on supervised learning techniques, and therefore need to be trained using a large amount of task-specific labeled training data. This presents a challenge as the large, annotated datasets required to train these models simply do not exist for every domain. [Some researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01044#:~:text=%5B2312.01044%5D%20Large%20Language%20Models%20Are%20Zero%2DShot%20Text%20Classifiers) motivated by these constraints say that LLMs are the way around these data limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are designed to perform natural language processing (NLP) and natural language inferencing (NLI) tasks which gives them a natural ability to perform zero-shot text classification. The model can generate data based on semantic descriptions [because](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.06410v1) it’s trained on a large corpus of data. Like LLMs, foundation models use a transformer architecture that enables them to classify labels without any specific training data for a classification task. This is [possible](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models) because of the models’ ability to perform self-supervised learning and transfer learning to classify data into unseen classes. To the advantage of data science, this approach eliminates the requirement for large datasets with human-annotated labels because it automates the preprocessing portion of the classification pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How foundation models perform zero-shot classification  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Foundation models are built on the [transformer architecture](https://research.ibm.com/blog/larger-context-window) that that can take raw text at scale through its attention mechanism, and understand how words relate to each other to form a statistical representation of language. The [transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10557) is a type of neural network architecture designed to interpret meaningful representations of sequences or collections of data points. This capability is the reason why these models perform so well on NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [transformer model architecture](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) includes an encoder-decoder structure and self-attention mechanism that allows the model to draw connections between input and output using [an auto-regressive](https://www.ibm.com/topics/autoregressive-model#:~:text=An%20autoregressive%20model%20is%20when,to%20predict%20the%20value%20now.) prediction. The encoder processes the [tokenized](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=solutions-tokens) input data into embeddings that represent the data in a format the model can read. The decoder interprets the embeddings to generate an output. The [self-attention mechanism](https://www.ibm.com/topics/transformer-model) computes the weights for each word, *or token,* in sentence based on its relationship to every other word in the sentence. This allows the model to take the semantic and syntactic relationships between words. The self-attention mechanism is integral for [entailment](https://research.ibm.com/publications/infusing-knowledge-into-the-textual-entailment-task-using-graph-convolutional-networks), a NLI task that heavily relies on the self-attention mechanism because it helps the model understand the context within text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What models are best for zero-shot classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right model for your zero-shot classification depends on your classification task. It’s no surprise that there is an abundance to choose from, let’s consider three types of models:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Zero-shot classification model** is a type of model that can classify data into categories without task-specific labeled examples during the prediction phase. The models rely on training data, which is normally a large-scale, general dataset to classify new, unseen classes. One of the most popular zero-shot classification models for zero-shot text classification is HuggingFace’s facebook/[bart-large-mnli](https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-classification) model based on the BART-large transformer model architecture. Zero-shot classification models perform well on generalized tasks but, because there is no fine-tuning on specific tasks or datasets, accuracy may be limited. Because of this limitation, the model requires well-formulated prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large Language Models** (LLMs) like GPT and BERT are designed to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks. This can limit use cases using multimodal datasets such as images and audio. These models are designed to handle text data, often using deep learning architectures likes [transformers](https://www.ibm.com/topics/transformer-model). LLMs are trained on a large corpora of text data, giving them extensive knowledge of language, syntax, semantics, and some domain-specific knowledge. These models generally perform well with little to no task-specific fine-tuning, making them suitable for zero-shot and few-shot classification scenarios. Due to their generalized training, LLMs may have limited accuracy for specialized tasks especially ones that require domain specific data. These models are best to work with when the dataset is text-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foundation models** are multimodal, meaning they are often trained on a myriad of modalities including text, images, and speech. These models are generally versatile and after pretraining can undergo optimization for many different tasks. IBM’s Granite (TM) models classify data by using a large language model (LLM) trained on a curated dataset of business-relevant information, including legal, financial, and technical domains, which allows it to analyze text and identify patterns to categorize data into specific classes based on the context and semantic meaning within the text. Because of their multimodal capacity, these types of models can handle image and text classification. These models are ideal when you need a broad range of capabilities or want to handle multiple types of data for instance, image or audio classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases \n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Image classification** – Computer vision is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows uses machine learning models to analyze images and videos. A crucial task within computer vision is [image classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/image-classification#:~:text=Image%20classification-,Image%20classification%20is%20the%20process%20of%20categorizing%20and%20labeling%20groups,supervised'%20and%20'unsupervised), which involves labeling and categorizing groups of pixels within an image. Image classification is used in many domains such as social media for photo tagging, self-driving cars, and even [healthcare](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/CVAMD/papers/Mahapatra_Medical_Image_Classification_Using_Generalized_Zero_Shot_Learning_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Text classification** – [NLP](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) utilizes text classification to enable the models understanding of human language. Text classification is used for many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, similarity scoring, key phrase detection and much more. A popular use case, and one we’ll be exploring in this tutorial, is for customer service analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Audio Classification** – The goal of audio classification is to use the model to recognize and distinguish between audio recordings so that it can perform sound categorization. This form of classification is used in smart home and security systems and technologies like text to speech applications.\n",
