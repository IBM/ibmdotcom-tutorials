    "# Evaluate RAG pipeline using Ragas in Python with watsonx\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contributors**: Anna Gutowska, Viktor Lukashov\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the Ragas framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation in Python using LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) is a technique in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) that combines information retrieval and generative models to produce more accurate, relevant and contextually aware responses. In traditional language generation tasks, large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or [IBM® Granite™ Models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) are used to construct responses based on an input prompt. Common real-world use cases of these large language models are chatbots. These models struggle to produce responses that are contextually relevant, factually accurate or up to date. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAG applications address this limitation by incorporating a retrieval step before response generation. During retrieval, additional text fragments relevant to the prompt are pulled from a knowledge base, such as relevant documents from a large corpus of text, typically stored in a vector database. Finally, an LLM is used for generating responses based on the original prompt augmented with the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview of RAG evaluation  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different RAG evaluation frameworks and evaluation metrics. Apart from [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas), other frameworks include IBM's [unitxt](https://github.com/IBM/unitxt) and OpenAI's [Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals/tree/main). Unlike the other frameworks, Ragas uses another LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the performance of a RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several evaluation metrics available for measuring the performance of our RAG pipeline. The metrics we will be using in the open source Ragas framework can be split into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generation evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **Faithfulness** measures if all generated answers can be inferred from the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **Answer relevancy** measures the relevancy of the generated response to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval evaluation**\n",
    " \n",
    "\t- **Context precision** measures the ranking of ground-truth relevant entities in the context. Higher context precision means ground-truth relevant items are ranked higher than “noise.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- **Context recall** measures the extent to which the LLM’s generated answers to user queries can be found in the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are meant to be subjective proxies for how well a RAG pipeline retrieves relevant information from its knowledge base to form a response. It is important to note, there is no ideal for data, prompts or LLMs. Even context that has a low scoring `context_relevance` is not necessarily bad context. The low score might be due to some amount of \"noise,\" or less relevant information, or simply because the task itself is open to multiple interpretations. Noise is not necessarily bad either. We, as humans, produce a certain amount of noise in our responses while also being intelligible in answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also biases that affect the evaluation of a RAG pipeline such as preference for either shorter or longer responses, otherwise known as length bias. This type of bias can lead to one response being evaluated higher than another because of its length and not its substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, it is best practice to perform multiple evaluations. This exercise can be accomplished through changing the LLM's prompt template, metrics, sequence of evaluation, and more. If you are creating your own data set for your RAG pipeline, it is also recommended to use different models for the LLM generating the responses and the LLM critiquing the responses. If the same model is used for both, then there is greater potential for self-evaluation bias. Because these evaluation metrics are subjective, the results produced by these frameworks should also be checked by human judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we do not create a RAG system. Instead, we are using Ragas to evaluate the output of a previously created RAG system. For more information about how to build your RAG system using LangChain, see our detailed [RAG tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/awb-create-langchain-rag-system-python-watsonx/). \n",

    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You need an IBM Cloud® account to create a [watsonx.ai™](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) project. [Sign up for a free account here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone) using your IBM Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a [watsonx.ai project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=projects-creating-project).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tYou can get your project ID from within your project. Click the **Manage** tab. Then, copy the project ID from the **Details** section of the **General** page. You need this ID for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=editor-creating-managing-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis step opens a notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial to implement a RAG evaluation of your own. Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset.

    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Generate a Watson Machine Learning (WML) service instance and application programming interface (API) key\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) service instance (select your appropriate region and choose the Lite plan, which is a free instance).  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Install and import relevant libraries and set up your credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a few libraries and modules for this tutorial. Make sure to import the ones listed and if  they're not installed, a quick pip installation resolves the problem. This tutorial was built using Python 3.11.9."

You are free to use any AI model of your choice to compare to this benchmark and choose the best fit for your application. The foundation models available through watsonx.ai can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models). The purpose of these models in LLM applications is to serve as the reasoning engine that decides which actions to take and responses to produce. To use the `WatsonxLLM` wrapper with Ragas, we need to use a `LangchainLLMWrapper`.   "
