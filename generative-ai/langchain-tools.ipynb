    "# Use custom and pre-built tools for an AI agent using LangChain with watsonx.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Anna Gutowska \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build custom tools for an AI agent to showcase its ability to differentiate appropriate use cases for each tool. We will be using the [LangChain Python package](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# AI agents overview\n",
    "An [artificial intelligence (AI) agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) is a system that performs tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its own workflow and utilizing available tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models or IBM® [Granite™ models](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) only have access to information used in training. AI agents differ from traditional LLMs due to their ability to plan, call tools, hold memory and reason through complex goals step-by-step. Agentic chatbots are becoming a common modality of this technology but there is a wide array of other industry applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to check out our AI Agents explainer for more in-depth information on the various AI agent types and their abstractions. In addition, other resources include our AI agent tutorial that builds a LangChain agent with custom tools using the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is tool calling? \n",
    "Tool calling is the interface that allows AI agents to work on specific tasks that require up-to-date information, otherwise unavailable to the trained LLM. We will be experimenting with the versatility of agents in this tutorial by exploring both custom and pre-built tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tools can be defined using various methods. They can be created from functions using the `@tool` decorator, as shown in this tutorial. Other options include LangChain Runnables and subclassing from BaseTool. For the distinctions between each approach, we encourage you to reference the official [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_tools/#tool-decorator).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You need an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration) using your IBM Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a [watsonx.ai project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tYou can get your project ID from within your project. Click the **Manage** tab. Then, copy the project ID from the **Details** section of the **General** page. You need this ID for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas).\n",
    "\n",
    "This step will open a Notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial to implement an AI agent of your own. Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset. This Jupyter Notebook is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/ibmdotcom-tutorials/blob/main/generative-ai/langchain-tools.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Set up a Watson Machine Learning service instance and API key\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) service instance (choose the Lite plan, which is a free instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate an [API Key in WML](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-authentication.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Associate the WML service to the project you created in [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/assoc-services.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Install and import relevant libraries and set up your credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need a few libraries and modules for this tutorial. Make sure to import the ones below, and if they're not installed, you can resolve this with a quick pip install. LangChain will be the framework and developer toolkit used."
