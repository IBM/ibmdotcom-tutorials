    "# LangChain tool calling using Granite-3.0-8B-Instruct in Python with watsonx.ai\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Anna Gutowska \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use prebuilt LangChain tools for an agentic ReAct agent to showcase its ability to differentiate appropriate use cases for each tool. We will primarily be using the opensource [LangChain Python package](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is tool calling? \n",
    "Tool calling, otherwise known as function calling, is the interface that allows AI agents to work on specific tasks that require up-to-date information, otherwise unavailable to the trained large language models (LLMs). LLMs such as [IBM® Granite™ models](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) or OpenAI’s GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models have access only to information used in training. There are many default tools accessible through LangChain including a tool for working with SQL database queries, accessing information on Wikipedia and much more. We encourage you to read the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/) for a comprehensive list of prebuilt tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom tools can be defined by using various methods including using the @tool decorator or LangChain Runnables which we'll cover in this tutorial. Async tools can be created by using the StructuredTool or the BaseTool classes. For distinctions between each approach, we encourage you to reference the official [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/custom_tools/). Refer to the IBM [function calling tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/think/tutorials/granite-function-calling) for examples of custom tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to check out our [AI Agents explainer](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) for an in-depth overview of the various AI agent types and how they differ from traditional LLM chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "You need an [IBM Cloud® account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps\n",
    "Check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sav6vUG_XQ) that walks you through the following set up instructions in steps 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Set up your environment\n",
    "While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai™](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?context=wx&apps=all) using your IBM Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a [watsonx.ai project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=projects-creating-project).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tYou can get your project ID from within your project. Click the **Manage** tab. Then, copy the project ID from the **Details** section of the **General** page. You need this ID for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=editor-creating-managing-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis step will open a Jupyter Notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial.  Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset. To view more Granite tutorials, check out the [IBM Granite Community](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community). This tutorial is also available on [Github](https://github.com/IBM/ibmdotcom-tutorials/tree/main/generative-ai/langchain-tools.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Set up a watsonx.ai Runtime instance and API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [watsonx.ai Runtime](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watsonxai-runtime) service instance (select your appropriate region and choose the Lite plan, which is a free instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate an [API Key](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-authentication.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Associate the watsonx.ai Runtime service instance to the project that you created in [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/assoc-services.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Install and import relevant libraries and set up your credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a few libraries and modules for this tutorial. Make sure to import the following ones and if they're not installed, you can resolve this with a quick pip installation. LangChain and LangGraph will be the frameworks and developer toolkits used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This tutorial was built using Python 3.11.9 and is also compatible with Google Colab which uses Python 3.10.12. To check your python version, you can run the `!python --version` command in a code cell."
