    "# How to Summarize Text Using Python NLP and Extractive Text Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, learn how Python text summarization works by exploring and comparing 3 classic extractive algorithms: Luhn's algorithm,<sup>1</sup> LexRank,<sup>2</sup> and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).<sup>3</sup>  \n",
    "\n",
    "While modern transformer model architectures based on neural networks dominate many NLP tasks, this tutorial\n",
    "focuses on classical approaches that remain valuable in data science workflows where interpretability, limited\n",
    "dependencies, and predictable summary length matter. These methods are often used to automate the generation of\n",
    "concise summaries from a large corpus without requiring a labeled dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How frequency-based, graph-based, and semantic summarization algorithms work.\n",
    "- The strengths and limitations of each approach.\n",
    "- How to implement these algorithms in Python using the Sumy library.\n",
    "- When to choose extractive versus abstractive text summarization for your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extractive vs abstractive summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization can be broadly categorized into two approaches: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extractive summarization** selects and combines existing sentences directly from the source text to create a summary. Think of it like highlighting the most important sentences in a document. This tutorial focuses on extractive methods, which dominated the field for decades and remain valuable for their interpretability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstractive summarization** generates new sentences to convey the original meaning, similar to how we might paraphrase or rewrite key points. Modern large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Granite, and Claude excel at this approach, although extractive methods still offer advantages in transparency and computational efficiency.Abstractive systems typically rely on transformers pre-trained on large-scale data, sometimes fine-tuned for specific summarization tasks or machine translation objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The evolution of extractive summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic text summarization began in 1958 with Hans Peter Luhn, an IBM researcher who published \"The Automatic Creation of Literature and Abstracts.\" Luhn's algorithm was groundbreaking in its simplicity: determine sentence importance by counting the frequency of meaningful words. Though basic by today's standards, this frequency-based approach established the foundation for subsequent work in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luhn's statistical method had clear limitations-- it couldn't capture semantic relationships, context, or nuance in language. Over the following decades, researchers expanded on his work by incorporating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph-based methods** like LexRank, which identify important sentences by analyzing similarity patterns across the entire document.\n",
    "- **Semantic approaches** like LSA, which uncover hidden thematic structures using linear algebra to understand meaning beyond surface-level word matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these algorithms illuminates fundamental concepts in information retrieval ([IR](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/information-retrieval)) and natural language processing (NLP), while illustrating the field's evolution from simple rule-based systems to the sophisticated deep-learning models we use today. Today, these\n",
    "models are commonly accessed through platforms like Hugging Face, exposed via an API, and powered by frameworks such as [PyTorch](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pytorch).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides a step-by-step walkthrough for implementing classic extractive text summarization\n",
    "algorithms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Clone the GitHub repository\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this project, clone the GitHub repository by using https://github.com/IBM/ibmdotcom-tutorials.git as the HTTPS URL. For\n",
    "detailed steps on how to clone a repository, refer to the GitHub documentation.\n",

    "[generative AI directory](https://github.com/IBM/ibmdotcom-tutorials/tree/main/generative-ai).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2. Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses a Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate text summarization with Python using the Sumy, a lightweight python library rather than a large-scale artificial intelligence system. Jupyter notebooks are versatile tools that\n",
    "allow you to combine code, text, and visualization in a single environment. You can run this notebook in your local IDE or\n",
    "explore cloud-based options like [watsonx.ai Runtime](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?utm_source=ibm_developer&utm_content=in_content_link&utm_id=tutorials_awb-create-langchain-rag-system-python-watsonx&cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-_-trial), which provides a managed environment for running Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you choose to run the notebook locally or in the cloud, the steps and code remain the same. Simply ensure that the\n",
    "required Python libraries are installed in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Install and import \n",
    "\n",

    "### Luhn\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the Luhn algorithm is a statistical, frequency-based approach to extractive\n",
    "summarization. Luhn's algorithm works on the premise that the most important sentences in a document are those\n",
    "that contain the most significant words. This approach makes Luhn particularly effective for quickly extracting \n",
    "salient sentences without semantic modeling. Significant words are determined by how frequently (but not *too*\n",
    "frequently) they occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Luhn algorithm workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing**: Common words, called **stop words**, that appear frequently in language ( like \"a\", \"this\", \"is\", \"the\") but have little meaningful information on their own are filtered out of the text data. A technique called stemming is applied to reduce words to their root forms (\"running\", \"runs\", \"ran\" -> \"run\"). \n",
    "2. **Word scoring**: The frequency of each word is calculated. Words that appear with moderate to high frequency are considered significant, while extremely common words, (including stop words), and very rare words are given less weight.\n",
    "3. **Sentence scoring**: Each sentence is scored based on clusters of significant words. A sentence's score is based on the density of significant words within these clusters, calculated as the ratio of significant words to total words in the cluster.\n",
    "4. **Summary generation**: The top-scoring sentences are selected and presented in their original order to create a summary.\n",

Sentences are connected with edges weighted by similarity scores. \n",
    "2. **Compute sentence centrality**: Importance scores are calculated for each sentence using an iterative voting process inspired by Google's PageRank algorithm. Each sentence begins with an equal score. In each iteration, a sentence's score is updated based on the scores of the sentences it is connected to. Sentences that are similar to many highly-scored sentences will themselves receive higher scores. This process repeats until the score stabilizes, with a dampening factor ensuring convergence. The result is a reinforcement effect where sentences discussing central themes naturally accumulate higher scores.\n",

In contrast, Luhn looks at word frequency, so it can still pick out the most important sentences even in sparse or messy text. This illustrates that while LexRank is powerful for well-structured documents, it’s not always the best choice for web scraping or heading-heavy content."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you explored three classic extractive summarization algorithms—Luhn, LexRank, and LSA—and learned how they approach the task in different ways. Luhn focuses on word frequency, LexRank uses sentence similarity, and LSA identifies underlying concepts to select the most meaningful sentences. Each method has its strengths: Luhn works well for general keyword-based summaries, LexRank is effective for structured text with clear sentence relationships, and LSA shines when you want a coherent, concept-focused overview of longer documents. Understanding these approaches gives you the foundation to choose the right extractive summarization technique for your projects and shows how the field has evolved from simple rule-based methods to sophisticated semantic analysis. These classic approaches also serve as strong baselines when evaluating modern abstractive\n",
