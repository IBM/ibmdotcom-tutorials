    "# Build a document-based question answering system by using Docling with Granite 3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors:** Ash Minhas, Anna Gutowska\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use IBM® [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) and open-source [Granite™ 3.1](https://www.ibm.com/granite) to perform document visual question answering for various file types. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Docling? \n",
    "\n",
    "Docling is an IBM open-source toolkit for parsing documents and exporting them to preferred formats. Input file formats include PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, Images, HTML, AsciiDoc and Markdown. These documents can be exported to markdown or JSON. Docling also provides [OCR (optical character recognition)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/optical-character-recognition) support for scanned documents. Use cases include scanning medical records, banking documents and even travel documents for quicker processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG and large context windows\n",
    "\n",
    "[Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation) is an architecture for connecting [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) with external knowledge bases without [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/fine-tuning) or retraining. Text is embedded, stored in a vector database and finally, is used by the pre-trained model to return relevant information for [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) and [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "When an LLM has a larger [context window](<https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/context-window#:~:text=The%20context%20window%20(or%20%E2%80%9Ccontext,of%20information%20into%20each%20output.>), the generative AI model can process more information at once. This means that we can use both RAG and models with large context windows to leverage the ability to efficiently process more relevant information at a time. The LLM we use in this tutorial is the IBM `Granite-3.1-8B-Instruct` model. This model extends to a context window size of 128K tokens. We will access the model locally by using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), without the use of an [API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api). This model is also available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite). \n"

       "\n",
       "1. Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift: It is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that extends Kubernetes with additional features and tools, enhancing productivity and security for businesses using container technology at scale.\n",

       "2. Benefits of Using Red Hat OpenShift for Container Orchestration: The document highlights the advantages of employing Red Hat OpenShift for managing containers, such as its comprehensive solution for hybrid cloud environments, including a container runtime, networking, monitoring, a container registry, authentication, and authorization.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Minimum IBM Power Requirements: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 can be installed on IBM Power 9 or IBM Power 10 processor-based systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Deploying Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Power Systems: This involves tailoring the networking infrastructure to leverage the robust capabilities and unique architecture of Power Systems, optimizing network performance for high throughput and low latency, ensuring network security and compliance, and managing network configurations for enterprise-level deployments.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Optimizing Network Performance: The document emphasizes the importance of faster storage, particularly for etcd on control plane nodes, as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is sensitive to disk performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Multi-Architecture Containerization: The text discusses key concepts in multi-architecture containerization and provides guidelines for implementing it using IBM Power control planes. It also addresses challenges and solutions related to multi-architecture containerization.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Security Aspects: Enterprise-grade security is mentioned as a crucial aspect of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Power systems, although specific details are not provided in the given context.\n",

       "**Question:** Can you summarize the conclusions?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Answer:** The document discusses the implementation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power systems for managing containers in a hybrid cloud environment. Here are the main conclusions drawn from this document:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Benefits: Red Hat OpenShift provides a comprehensive solution for hybrid cloud environments, encompassing essential components such as a container runtime, networking, monitoring, a container registry, authentication, and authorization. It extends Kubernetes with additional features and tools to enhance productivity and security, making it an ideal choice for businesses looking to leverage container technology at scale.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Minimum Requirements: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 can be installed on IBM Power 9 or IBM Power 10 processor-based systems. For comprehensive guidance and further information on installation and configuration, refer to the IBM Redbooks publication Implementing, Tuning, and Optimizing Workloads with Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Power (SG24-8537) and Red Hat OpenShift Documentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Deployment Process: Deploying Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Power Systems involves tailoring the networking infrastructure to fully leverage the robust capabilities and unique architecture of Power Systems. This includes optimizing network performance for high throughput and low latency, ensuring network security and compliance, and managing network configurations to meet enterprise-level demands.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Network Performance Optimization: Faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on control plane nodes. On many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Multi-Architecture Containerization: Red Hat OpenShift supports multiple architectures (x86 and IBM Power) with RHOS 4.14 or later, simplifying the management of your Red Hat OpenShift environment on both x86 and IBM Power servers.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Security Aspects: The integration of Red Hat OpenShift running on IBM Power servers with existing infrastructure involves strategic networking solutions that bridge on-premises systems with your new cloud environment. This enables organizations to leverage the strengths of both infrastructures for enhanced flexibility, scalability, and resilience while ensuring network security and compliance.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Performance Tuning: The document does not provide specific details about performance tuning; however, it is mentioned that optimizing network performance for high throughput and low latency is essential. For comprehensive guidance on performance tuning, refer to the IBM Redbooks publication Implementing, Tuning, and Optimizing Workloads with Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Power (SG24-8537) and Red Hat OpenShift Documentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, this document highlights that implementing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power systems offers a robust foundation for developing, deploying, and scaling cloud-native applications in a hybrid cloud environment. It emphasizes the importance of optimizing network performance, ensuring security, and leveraging multi-architecture containerization capabilities to create an efficient and flexible solution for managing containers."
