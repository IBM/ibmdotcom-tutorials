It's part of a family of ensemble learning methods, along with bagging, which combine the predictions of multiple simpler models to improve overall performance. Gradient boosting regression uses gradient boosting to better generate output data based on a linear regression. A gradient boosting classifier, which you\u2019ll explore in this tutorial, uses gradient boosting to better classify input data as belonging to two or more different classes. Gradient boosting is an update of the adaboost algorithm that uses decision stumps rather than trees. These decision stumps are similar to trees in a random forest but they have only one node and two leaves. The gradient boosting algorithm builds models sequentially, each step tries to correct the mistakes of the previous iteration. The training process often begins with creating a weak learner like a shallow decision tree for the training data. After that initial training, gradient boosting computes the error between the actual and predicted values (often called residuals) and then trains a new estimator to predict this error. That new tree is added to the ensemble to update the predictions to create a strong learner. Gradient boosting repeats this process until improvement stops or until a fixed number of iterations has been reached. Boosting itself is similar to gradient descent but \u201cdescends\u201d the gradient by introducing new models. Boosting has several advantages: it has good performance on tabular data and it can handle both numerical and categorical data. It works well even with default parameters and is robust to outliers in the dataset. However, it can be slow to train and often highly sensitive to the hyperparameters set for the training process. Keeping the number of trees created smaller can speed up the training process when working with a large dataset. This step is usually done through the max depth parameter. Gradient boosting can also be prone to overfitting if not tuned properly. To prevent overfitting, you can configure the learning rate for the training process. This process is roughly the same for a classifier or a gradient boosting regressor and is used in the popular xgboost, which builds on gradient boosting by adding regularization.</p> <p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use two different programming languages and gradient boosting libraries to classify penguins by using the popular Palmer Penguins dataset.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/ai-models/gradient_boosting_classifier/#step-1-create-a-notebook-using-r","title":"Step 1 Create a Notebook using R\u00b6","text":"<p>While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook.</p> <p>Log in to watsonx.ai by using your IBM Cloud\u00ae account.</p> <p>Create a watsonx.ai project.</p> <p>You can get your project ID from within your project.

In particular, multivariate time series forecasting allows us to model the interactions between multiple variables as they change over time. This is helpful when performing estimations with exogenous variables (like weather) that may influence a target variable (like energy demand). In this context, weather is an independent variable which may have an impact on our target variable. In contrast, energy demand represents an endogenous variable, dependent on it's own earlier values in the time series and potentially other external variables like the weather.</p> <p>This tutorial focuses on using the sktime library\u2014a unified framework for machine learning with time series data. Sktime aims to simplify the workflow for time series problems by providing consistent, composable tools for tasks like forecasting, classification, and transformation. Its design is inspired by the scikit-learn API, making it approachable for those familiar with Python's broader ML ecosystem. Sktime also allows users to create pipelines tailored to time series data by combining dedicated transformers and classifiers. Forecasting pipelines allow for the sequential application of preprocessing steps and forecasting models, facilitating a streamlined workflow for time series forecasting tasks. While this tutorial solely focuses on comparing univariate and multivariate forecasting models, it's worth noting that sktime also supports hierarchical forecasting, enabling the application of different forecasting models at various levels of data aggregation and fine tuning by the use of hyperparameters. Sktime allows for time series classification, regression, and clustering while enabling users to switch between models without changing how one prepares or runs the code.

Naive forecasting methods are based on the assumption that the best predictor of a future value is the current value <sup>1</sup>. For our use case of hourly energy demand, we can think of the simplest implementation of naive forecasting to mean that the predicted energy demand for the next hour should be equal to the previous hour's energy demand. In practice, adding a small amount of random variation to naive predictions often improves them.</p> <p>We can also improve naive forecasts by taking advantage of seasonal patterns observed in our data. In the case of our hourly energy demand data, we can see patterns in the time series within a one day period, indicating a seasonal periodicity of a day. Instead of forecasting the next hour's energy demand to be similar to the previous hour's energy demand, we can forecast the next hour's energy demand to be similar to the energy demand for that same hour on the previous day.</p> <p>To do this, we'll first specify the forecaster to use, in this case the <code>NaiveForecaster</code>. The <code>NaiveForecaster</code> works by generating a 'last window' of historical data on which to base the forecasts. In the case of our hourly energy demand data with observed intra-day seasonality, our window length will consist of the previous 24-hour period for this 'last window'.</p> <p>We have to specify a <code>strategy</code> to the forecaster, describing how to utilize the data in the 'last window'. We set the strategy as <code>last</code>, meaning that the forecaster should take into account the last value in the window, as opposed to taking a mean over all the data in the window. In combination, we set the seasonal periodicity or <code>sp</code> to <code>24</code> to account for the intra-day seasonality that we have observed. Together, these two settings implement our seasonal naive strategy described above, where the value of energy demand at a given hour is predicted using the energy demand at that hour on the previous day.</p> <p>Once the forecaster is initialized with the parameters as described above, we call the <code>fit</code> method on the <code>forecaster</code>, passing our data <code>y['total load actual]</code> which contains the rows of historical data that we pass to our model for input.

By combining powerful language generation with external knowledge retrieval techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), they enable advanced reasoning, question answering, and task automation across diverse domains. However, despite their remarkable capabilities, these models often face challenges such as inconsistent robustness across systems, high token usage, slow response times, and inefficiencies caused by repetitive prompting and redundant context, when tackling complex tasks. Such limitations increase operational costs and hinder scalability and real-time performance.</p> <p>To overcome these issues, the ReWOO (Reasoning WithOut Observation) framework offers a novel approach that focuses on decoupling reasoning from external knowledge retrieval. Instead of having a single LLM try to reason, act, and observe in an interleaved manner, ReWOO separates these concerns into distinct modules, each potentially powered by an LLM but with a specific role. By modularizing the process into distinct planning, evidence gathering, and synthesis stages, ReWOO improves token efficiency and accuracy. It also makes the system easier to debug and enables more streamlined and effective AI workflows.</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>!pip install transformers accelerate torch requests\n</pre> !pip install transformers accelerate torch requests In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>import requests\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline\n</pre> import requests from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline  In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>model_id = \"ibm-granite/granite-3.2-2b-instruct\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\ngenerator = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\n</pre> model_id = \"ibm-granite/granite-3.2-2b-instruct\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id) generator = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer) In\u00a0[5]: Copied! <pre>import os\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display  # This Image is correct!\n\n# Expand the path to your image\nimg_path = r\"C:\\Users\\JobitVarughese\\Desktop\\ReWOO.jpg\"\n\n# Display the image\ndisplay(Image(filename=img_path))\n</pre> import os from IPython.display import Image, display  # This Image is correct!  # Expand the path to your image img_path = r\"C:\\Users\\JobitVarughese\\Desktop\\ReWOO.jpg\"  # Display the image display(Image(filename=img_path)) <p><code>def query_serper(question, num_results=3)</code>: Defines a function that takes a search question and returns relevant snippets from the top search results.</p> <p><code>payload = {\"q\": question, \"num\": num_results}</code>: Prepares the query payload with the search term and number of results to return.</p> <p><code>response = requests.post(...)</code>: Sends a POST request to the Serper API with your query and headers.</p> <p><code>response.raise_for_status()</code>: Raises an error if the API response is invalid or fails.</p> <p><code>snippets = [...]</code>: Extracts snippet text from the organic search results.</p> <p><code>return \"\\n\".join(snippets)</code>: Joins and returns the snippets as a single string, serving as context for the language model.</p> <p>Note: This function forms the backbone of ReWOO\u2019s \u201cobservation\u201d step, where external evidence is gathered for further reasoning.

And to keep them coming back for more, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) has worked side-by-side with IBM Consulting\u00ae for more than three decades, developing and delivering a world-class digital experience that constantly advances its features and functionality.\\n\\n\u201cThe digital experience of the US Open is of enormous importance to our global fans, and therefore to us,\u201d says Kirsten Corio, Chief Commercial Officer at the USTA. \u201cThat means we need to constantly innovate to meet the modern demands of tennis fans, anticipating their needs, but also surprising them with new and unexpected experiences.\u201d\\nTo help the US Open stay on the cutting edge of customer experience, IBM Consulting worked closely with the USTA to develop generative AI models that transform tennis data into insights and original content on the US Open app and website. To do this, the USTA used IBM\u00ae watsonx\u2122, an AI and data platform built for business, and powerful AI models, including IBM Granite\u2122 foundation models, to help develop key app features, such as Match Reports and AI Commentary for US Open highlight reels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      15M\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorld-class digital experiences for more than 15 million fans around the globe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      7M\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIBM captures and analyzes more than 7 million data points throughout the tournament\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            \\n                \\n                     \\n                        \\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      The AI models built with watsonx do more than enhance the digital experience of the US Open.

Keeping up with all the action is a challenge, both for tennis fans and the USTA editorial team covering the event. So, the USTA asked IBM to design, develop, and deliver solutions that enhance the digital experience and help its team serve up more content, covering more matches throughout the tournament.\\nTo do it, the IBM Consulting team built generative AI-powered features using the watsonx AI and data platform. For example, Match Reports are AI-generated post-match summaries that are designed to get fans quickly up to speed on the action from around the tournament. AI Commentary adds AI-generated, spoken commentary to match highlights. And SlamTracker\u2013the premier scoring application for the US Open\u2013features AI-generated match previews and recaps.\\n\u201cThe AI models built with watsonx do more than enhance the digital experience of the US Open,\u201d says Kirsten Corio, Chief Commercial Officer, USTA. \u201cThey also scale the productivity of our editorial team by automating key workflows.\u201d\\nThe IBM team worked with multiple AI models to develop the new features, including the family of Granit AI models. These large language models already understand language, but they needed to be trained, or \u201ctuned,\u201d on tennis data in order to translate US Open action into sentences and summaries.\\n\u201cFoundation models are incredibly powerful and are ushering in a new age of generative AI,\u201d says Shannon Miller, a Partner at IBM Consulting. \u201cBut to generate meaningful business outcomes, they need to be trained on high-quality data and develop domain expertise. And that\u2019s why an organization\u2019s proprietary data is the key differentiator when it comes to AI.\u201d\\nThe team used watsonx.data to connect and curate the USTA\u2019s trusted data sources. The curation process includes de-duping and filtering the foundational data that informs the large language model, as well as the USTA\u2019s proprietary data. The process filters for things like profanity or abusive language and objectionable content.\\nThe models were then trained to translate tennis data into cogent descriptions, summarizing entire matches in the case of Match Reports, or generating sentences that describe the action in highlight reels for AI Commentary. Over the course of the 2024 US Open, Match Reports and AI Commentary will be generated for all men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles matches; something the USTA editorial team has never done before. And the ongoing operation of the models is monitored and managed using elements of watsonx.governance, which ensures the AI is performant, compliant and operating as expected.\\nDuring the software development phase of the project, the team took advantage of a powerful generative AI assistant to increase the efficiency and accuracy of its code. IBM watsonx Code Assistant\u2122 uses generative AI from a purpose-built Granite model to accelerate software development, helping developers generate code based on natural language prompts. The team used this tool to analyze and explain snippets of code, annotate code to facilitate better collaboration between developers, and auto-complete snippets of analyzed code.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n                \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Platform of innovation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo develop new capabilities every year, the USTA needs to move with speed and purpose. The process starts the week after the US Open concludes, when IBM Consulting kicks off work using the IBM Garage\u2122 Methodology, a highly collaborative approach to co-creation.\\n\u201cWhen we engage with a client, it\u2019s critical that we work closely together every step of the way, ideating, iterating and adapting as we drive toward the client\u2019s desired end state,\u201d says Miller.\\nIn order to transform new ideas into digital reality, IBM Consulting designs, develops, and manages a powerful digital infrastructure capable of processing structured and unstructured data, and integrating technology from a variety of sources. This foundational infrastructure is advanced and improved upon every year.\\n\u201cIt used to be that innovation cycles were measured in years,\u201d says the USTA\u2019s Corio. \u201cBut now, innovation is measured in weeks and days, and it can come from anywhere. So, we needed a flexible platform that could handle all kinds of data, automate the process of turning data into insight, and do it all while protecting the entire digital environment.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n                \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    From data to insight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe raw material of any digital experience is data, and the US Open tournament produces a lot of it. For starters, each US Open consists of 128 men and 128 women singles players, and a total of seven rounds for each tournament. Each tennis player comes with his or her own data set, including world ranking and recent performance. But that\u2019s just the beginning.\\nOver the course of the tournament, more than 125,000 points will be played. And each one of those points generates its own data set: serve direction, speed, return shot type, winner shot type, rally count and even ball position. All told, more than seven million data points are generated during the tournament.\\nTo add more texture and context to the US Open digital experience, the team wanted to go beyond the numbers. So, they used AI to analyze the language and sentiment of millions of articles from hundreds of thousands of different sources to develop insights that are unique and informative, for instance, the likelihood to Win predictions for all singles matches. To help manage the collection, integration, and analysis of the data sets, IBM used IBM watsonx.data\u2122, a purpose-built data store specifically designed to handle AI workloads.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive data management operation, incorporating multiple sources of data and a variety of partners,\u201d says Miller. \u201cBut the magic happens when you combine hard data like stats and scores with unstructured data like media commentary. That is what gives tennis fans a more complete picture of each match.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Automation, containerization and other efficiencies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo streamline this process, during the years working with the UTSA, IBM Consulting built automated workflows that integrate and orchestrate the flow of data through the various applications and AI models needed to produce the digital experience. These workflows are made possible by a hybrid cloud architecture and the containerized apps running on Red Hat\u00ae\\xa0OpenShift\u00ae\\xa0on IBM Cloud.\\xa0The US Open hybrid multicloud architecture is made up of four public clouds, drawing on data from a variety of sources and integrating features and capability from a variety of partners.

In traditional language generation tasks, large language models (LLMs) such as Meta's Llama Models or IBM\u2019s Granite Models are used to construct responses based on an input prompt. Common real-world use cases of these large language models are chatbots.

Agentic technology implements tool use on the backend to obtain up-to-date information from various data sources, optimize workflow and create subtasks autonomously to solve complex tasks. These external tools can include external data sets, search engines, APIs and even other agents.

RAG agents can also have tools for tasks such as solving mathematical calculations, writing emails, performing data analysis and more. These tools can be supplemental to the agent's decision-making process. AI agents are context-aware in their multistep reasoning and can determine when to use appropriate tools.</p> <p>AI agents, or intelligent agents, can also work collaboratively in multiagent systems, which tend to outperform singular agents.

Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.\n\n- [Core API](./python/packages/autogen-core/) implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power.

Similarly, agentic RAG leverages an AI agent\u2019s ability to plan and execute subtasks along with the retrieval of relevant information to supplement an LLM's knowledge base. This ability allows for the optimization and greater scalability of RAG applications compared to traditional chatbots. No longer do we need to write complex SQL queries to extract relevant data from a knowledge base.</p> <p>The future of agentic RAG is multi-agent RAG, where several specialized agents collaborate to achieve optimal latency and efficiency. We will demonstrate this collaboration by using a small, efficient model such as Granite 3.2 and combining it with a modular agent architecture. We will use multiple specialized \"mini agents\" that collaborate to achieve tasks through adaptive planning and tool or function calling. Like humans, a team of agents, or a multi-agent system, often outperforms the heroic efforts of an individual, especially when they have clearly defined roles and effective communication.</p> <p>For the orchestration of this collaboration, we can use AutoGen (AG2) as the core framework to manage workflows and decision-making, alongside other tools like Ollama for local LLM serving and Open WebUI for interaction. AutoGen is a framework for creating multi-agent AI applications developed by Microsoft.1 Notably, every one of the components leveraged in this tutorial is open source.

Like humans, agents perform best when they have targeted instructions and just enough context to make an informed decision. Too much extraneous information, such as an unfiltered chat history, can create a \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d problem, where it becomes increasingly difficult to decipher signal from noise.</p> <p>In this agentic AI architecture, the agents work together sequentially to achieve the goal. Here is how the generative AI system is organized:</p> <p>Planner agent: Creates the initial high-level plan, once in the beginning of the workflow. For example, if a user asks, \u201cWhat are comparable open source projects to the ones my team is using?\u201d then, the agent will put together a step-by-step plan that might look something like this: \u201c1. Search team documents for open source technologies. 2. Search the web for similar open source projects to the ones found in step 1.\u201d If any of these steps fail or provide insufficient results, the steps can be later adapted by the reflection agent.</p> <p>Research Aasistant: The research assistant is the workhorse of the system. It takes in and executes instructions such as \u201cSearch team documents for open source technologies.\u201d For step 1 of the plan, it uses the initial instruction from the planner agent. For subsequent steps, it also receives curated context from the outcomes of previous steps.</p> <p>For example, if asked to \u201cSearch the web for similar open source projects,\u201d it will also receive the output from the previous document search step. Depending on the instruction, the research assistant can use tools like web search or document search, or both, to fulfill its task.</p> <p>Step critic: The step critic is responsible for deciding whether the output of the previous step satisfactorily fulfilled the instruction it was given. It receives two pieces of information: the single-step instruction that was just executed and the output of that instruction. Having a step critic weigh in on the conversation brings clarity around whether the goal was achieved, which is needed for the planning of the next step.</p> <p>Goal judge: The goal judge determines whether the ultimate objective has been met, based on all of the requirements of the provided goal, the plans drafted to achieve it, and the information gathered so far. The output of the judge is either \"YES\" or \"NOT YET\" followed by a brief explanation that is no longer than one or two sentences.</p> <p>Reflection agent: The reflection agent is our executive decision-maker. It decides what step to take next, whether that is encroaching onto the next planned step, pivoting course to make up for mishaps or confirming that the goal has been completed. Like a real-life CEO, it performs its best decision-making when it has a clear goal in mind and is presented with concise findings on the progress that has or has not been made to reach that goal. The output of the reflection agent is either the next step to take or the instructions to terminate if the goal has been reached. We present the reflection agent with the following items:</p> <ul> <li>The goal</li> <li>The original plan</li> <li>The last step that was executed</li> <li>The result of the last step indicating success or failure</li> <li>A concise sequence of previously executed instructions (just the instructions, not their output)</li> </ul> <p>Presenting these items in a structured format makes it clear to our decision maker what has been done so that it can decide what needs to happen next.</p> <p>Report Generator: Once the goal is achieved, the Report Generator synthesizes all findings into a cohesive output that directly answers the original query. While each step in the process generates targeted outputs, the Report Generator ties everything together into a final report.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/autogen-local-multi-agent-rag/#leveraging-open-source-tools","title":"Leveraging open source tools\u00b6","text":"<p>For beginners, it can be difficult to build an agentic AI application from scratch. Hence, we will use a set of open source tools.

This interface acts as the primary point for submitting queries (such as \u201cFetch me the latest news articles pertaining to my project notes\u201d) and viewing the outputs.</p> <p>Python-based agent (AG2 framework): At the core of the system is a Python-based agent built by using AutoGen (AG2). This agent coordinates the workflow by breaking down tasks and dynamically calling tools to execute steps.</p> <p>The agent has access to two primary tools:</p> <ul> <li><p>Document search tool: Fetches relevant information from a vector database containing uploaded project notes or documents stored as embeddings. This vector search leverages the built-in documental retrieval APIs inside Open WebUI, rather than setting up an entirely separate data store.</p> </li> <li><p>Web search tool: Performs web-based searches to gather external knowledge and real-time information.

The Granite LLM was invoked by using Ollama, allowing for a fully local exploration of these systems. As a next step, consider integrating more custom tools into your agentic system.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/deepseek_rag_reasoning_docling_watsonx/","title":"DeepSeek Reasoning: Improving the R1 distilled model with RAG and watsonx.ai","text":"In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre># Install required packages\n!pip install -q \"langchain&gt;=0.1.0\" \"langchain-community&gt;=0.0.13\" \"langchain-core&gt;=0.1.17\" \\\n    \"langchain-ollama&gt;=0.0.1\" \"pdfminer.six&gt;=20221105\" \"markdown&gt;=3.5.2\" \"docling&gt;=2.0.0\" \\\n    \"beautifulsoup4&gt;=4.12.0\" \"unstructured&gt;=0.12.0\" \"chromadb&gt;=0.4.22\" \"faiss-cpu&gt;=1.7.4\" \\\n    \"requests&gt;=2.32.0\" \"langchain-ibm&gt;=0.3.5\"\n</pre> # Install required packages !pip install -q \"langchain&gt;=0.1.0\" \"langchain-community&gt;=0.0.13\" \"langchain-core&gt;=0.1.17\" \\     \"langchain-ollama&gt;=0.0.1\" \"pdfminer.six&gt;=20221105\" \"markdown&gt;=3.5.2\" \"docling&gt;=2.0.0\" \\     \"beautifulsoup4&gt;=4.12.0\" \"unstructured&gt;=0.12.0\" \"chromadb&gt;=0.4.22\" \"faiss-cpu&gt;=1.7.4\" \\     \"requests&gt;=2.32.0\" \"langchain-ibm&gt;=0.3.5\" In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre># Required imports\nimport os\nimport tempfile\nimport shutil\nimport getpass\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown, display\nfrom langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM\n\n# Docling imports\nfrom docling.datamodel.base_models import InputFormat\nfrom docling.datamodel.pipeline_options import PdfPipelineOptions, TesseractCliOcrOptions\nfrom docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter, PdfFormatOption, WordFormatOption, SimplePipeline\n\n# LangChain imports\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader, WebBaseLoader\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain_ollama import OllamaEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\nfrom ibm_watsonx_ai.metanames import GenTextParamsMetaNames as GenParams\n</pre> # Required imports import os import tempfile import shutil import getpass  from pathlib import Path from IPython.display import Markdown, display from langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM  # Docling imports from docling.datamodel.base_models import InputFormat from docling.datamodel.pipeline_options import PdfPipelineOptions, TesseractCliOcrOptions from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter, PdfFormatOption, WordFormatOption, SimplePipeline  # LangChain imports from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader, WebBaseLoader from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain_ollama import OllamaEmbeddings from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from ibm_watsonx_ai.metanames import GenTextParamsMetaNames as GenParams <p>To set our credentials, we need the <code>WATSONX_APIKEY</code> and <code>WATSONX_PROJECT_ID</code> you generated in step 1.

Be explicit about the technical approach and technologies using the provided context from IBM's website.\" ask_question(qa_chain, question) <p>Question: List out the key scope and requirements of the RFP. Then draft a detailed RFP response as though it was written by IBM. Be explicit about the technical approach and technologies using the provided context from IBM's website.</p> <p>Answer:  Okay, so I need to figure out what exactly the user is asking here. They've given me some sections from an RFP document and then asked two things: first, to list the key scope and requirements of the RFP based on the provided context; second, to draft a detailed RFP response as if it were from IBM, making sure to explicitly mention the technical approach and technologies, possibly pulling info from IBM's site since they mentioned that.</p> <p>Alright, starting with part one\u2014key scope and requirements. Looking through the context snippets, there are several points that stand out. First, under VII. QUESTIONS, it says that any questions related to the RFP should be emailed to a specific address, referencing the relevant pages and sections according to the schedule in Section IV. Also, late questions might not get answers, and all Q&amp;As will be publicly posted. That tells me communication protocols and deadlines are important.</p> <p>Then, VIII. GENERAL PROVISIONS mentions that each bidder needs to submit a clear, concise proposal focusing on compliance with RFP instructions, completeness, and clarity. So, the proposal has to strictly adhere to guidelines, probably including formatting and content specifics.</p> <p>Looking further down, under A. MINIMUM QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS, bidders must detail their current capabilities, past experience especially with states and big cities, and how that applies to NYS. This indicates that relevant experience and adaptability to NY\u2019s environment are crucial.</p> <p>There's also something about proper format: creating a named folder and uploading via a Dropbox link. Late submissions aren\u2019t allowed, so timeliness is another requirement.</p> <p>Section D. PROJECT PLAN/APPROACH requires demonstrating competence and capacity, likely meaning a solid project plan is needed. Similarly, C. STAFF EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS emphasizes having knowledgeable and capable staff, supported perhaps by references who can vouch for their performance.</p> <p>Additionally, the TECHNICAL PROPOSAL includes elements like table of contents, estimated cost, diversity practices, etc., showing that multiple aspects beyond just technical skills are evaluated.</p> <p>So compiling all that, the key scope seems to involve developing a next-gen software solution tailored to NYS needs, while the main requirements would cover submission guidelines, necessary documentation (like project plans, team qualifications), minimum qualifications (past experience, capability), adherence to formats, timely delivery, and inclusion of various administrative parts.</p> <p>Now moving to drafting the RFP response as IBM. Since I'm supposed to use context from IBM's website, I'll think about their strengths. IBM often touts AI, cloud solutions, data analytics, blockchain, IoT, and strong consulting services. Their approach usually involves scalable, secure, and innovative tech.</p> <p>I\u2019d structure the response to mirror the RFP sections. Start with understanding the problem, aligning with NYS goals. Highlight IBM's experience with similar projects, maybe reference state-level engagements. Detail the technical approach: perhaps leveraging IBM Cloud, Watson AI tools for automation, integrating advanced analytics for decision-making, ensuring security measures, and utilizing agile methodologies for development.</p> <p>Include project management strategies, emphasizing experienced teams and proven track records. Address diversity practices, mentioning IBM's commitment to inclusivity and equal opportunities. Finally, present a cost estimate structured around these components without being too vague.</p> <p>But wait, looking back, the initial instruction said to only proceed if confident, else admit lack of knowledge. However, considering the extensive details above, I believe I can construct a reasonable outline even without direct access to IBM's latest materials beyond general knowledge.</p> <p>Wait again\u2014the user actually wants me to write both the key scope/requirements and then the detailed RFP response. But when I look more closely, the \"helpful answer\" example didn't fully execute both tasks\u2014it started explaining thought processes instead.

This development has caused significant debate about whether LLMs are truly capable of reasoning or whether they are simply imitating human decision-making by following the patterns present in their training data.</p> <p>There are many types of reasoning such as common sense, abductive, deductive and inductive reasoning. These forms of reasoning are innate to many of us humans, but it is exceedingly difficult to build an AI model capable of excelling in all forms of reasoning. LLMs are bound by the knowledge acquired during the training process. A model might excel in mathematical reasoning or a common benchmark but might completely falter when applied to a different use case. If LLMs are truly capable of multi-step reasoning, their capacity to do so would be general and not limited to a particular example. Hence, in this tutorial, we recognize human and LLM reasoning as distinct from one another.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/deepseek_rag_reasoning_docling_watsonx/#ways-to-improve-llm-reasoning","title":"Ways to improve LLM reasoning\u00b6","text":"<p>To supplement an LLM\u2019s training data without fine-tuning, we can perform retrieval augmented generation (RAG). RAG is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that grounds the model on an up-to-date, accurate dataset to facilitate in-context learning.</p> <p>To encourage complex reasoning and problem-solving, chain of thought (CoT) prompting can also be used. Chain of thought reasoning is an approach in artificial intelligence that simulates human-like reasoning processes by decoding complex problems into reasoning steps toward a final resolution. Variants of chain of thought prompting can be zero-shot, automatic and multimodal.</p> <p>DeepSeek-R1 combines chain of thought reasoning with reinforcement learning to enhance performance.

They produce their responses based on the data used to train them and are difficult to adapt to personalized user queries. To obtain the missing information, these generative AI models can integrate external tools within the function calling. This method is one way to avoid fine-tuning a foundation model for each specific use-case. The function calling examples in this tutorial will implement external API calls.</p> <p>The Granite-3.0-8B-Instruct model and tokenizer use natural language processing (NLP) to parse query syntax. In addition, the models use function descriptions and function parameters to determine the appropriate tool calls. Key information is then extracted from user queries to be passed as function arguments.</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre># installations\n%pip install -q transformers\n%pip install -q torch torchvision\n%pip install -q langchain-ibm\n</pre> # installations %pip install -q transformers %pip install -q torch torchvision %pip install -q langchain-ibm In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>#imports\nimport requests\nimport ast\nimport re\nimport getpass\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nfrom transformers.utils import get_json_schema\nfrom langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM\n</pre> #imports import requests import ast import re import getpass  from transformers import AutoTokenizer from transformers.utils import get_json_schema from langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM <p>Next, we can prepare our environment by setting the model ID for the <code>granite-3-8b-instruct</code> model, and the tokenizer for the same Granite model.</p> <p>Input your <code>WATSONX_APIKEY</code> and <code>WATSONX_PROJECT_ID</code> that you created in steps 1 and 2 upon running the following cell.</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>MODEL_ID = \"ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct\"\n\nTOKENIZER = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct\")\n\nWATSONX_URL = \"https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com\"\n\nWATSONX_APIKEY = getpass.getpass(\"Please enter your watsonx.ai Runtime API key (hit enter): \")\n\nWATSONX_PROJECT_ID = getpass.getpass(\"Please enter your project ID (hit enter): \")\n</pre> MODEL_ID = \"ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct\"  TOKENIZER = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct\")  WATSONX_URL = \"https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com\"  WATSONX_APIKEY = getpass.getpass(\"Please enter your watsonx.ai Runtime API key (hit enter): \")  WATSONX_PROJECT_ID = getpass.getpass(\"Please enter your project ID (hit enter): \") <p>The <code>get_stock_price</code> function in this tutorial requires an <code>AV_STOCK_API_KEY</code> key.

Various machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence computation techniques are used to convert speech into text. Speech recognition technology has evolved significantly from its beginnings in the mid-twentieth century to today.</p> <p>In the 1960s, spectrograms were initially used to analyze speech. In the subsequent decades, a shift to statistical models occurred. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) appeared and became dominant for modeling sequences of small sound units known as phonemes in linguistics. ASR systems architecture was made up of three separate components: an acoustic model, a language model and a decoder.</p> <p>By the 2010s, advancements in deep learning began impacting the traditional speech recognition systems architecture. Encoder-decoder models might use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture where an encoder processes input data and a decoder generates output based on the encoder's representation. Models can be trained on large unlabeled datasets of audio-text pairs to learn how to correspond audio signals with transcriptions. Popular ASR models include DeepSpeech and Wav2Vec.</p> <p>Today, virtual assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana use ASR technology to process real-time human speech. They are also able to integrate speech-to-text with large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP). LLMs  can be used to add context, which can help when word choices are more ambiguous or if there is variability in human speech patterns.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/granite-speech-3.3-8b/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites\u00b6","text":"<p>You need an IBM Cloud\u00ae account to create a watsonx.ai project.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/granite-speech-3.3-8b/#steps","title":"Steps\u00b6","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/granite-speech-3.3-8b/#step-1-set-up-your-environment","title":"Step 1.

Graph RAG is an alternative to vector search methods that use a vector database. Knowledge graphs are knowledge systems where graph databases such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune can represent structured data. In a knowledge graph, the relationships between data points, called edges, are as meaningful as the connections between data points, called vertices or sometimes nodes. A knowledge graph makes it easy to traverse a network and process complex queries about connected data. Knowledge graphs are especially well suited for use cases involving chatbots, identity resolution, network analysis, recommendation engines, customer 360 and fraud detection.</p> <p>A Graph RAG approach leverages the structured nature of graph databases to give greater depth and context of retrieved information about networks or complex relationships. When a graph database is paired with a large language model (LLM), a developer can automate significant parts of the graph creation process from unstructured data like text. An LLM can process text data and identify entities, understand their relationships and represent them in a graph structure.</p> <p>There are many ways to create a Graph RAG application, for instance Microsoft\u2019s GraphRAG, or pairing GPT4 with LlamaIndex. For this tutorial you\u2019ll use Memgraph, an open source graph database solution to create a rag system by using Meta\u2019s Llama-3 on watsonx. Memgraph uses Cypher, a declarative query language. It shares some similarities with SQL but focuses on nodes and relationships rather than tables and rows. You\u2019ll have Llama 3 both create and populate your graph database from unstructured text and query information in the database.</p> In\u00a0[3]: Copied! <pre>import os\n \nfrom langchain_community.chains.graph_qa.memgraph import MemgraphQAChain\nfrom langchain_community.graphs import MemgraphGraph\n \nurl = os.environ.get(\"MEMGRAPH_URI\", \"bolt://localhost:7687\")\nusername = os.environ.get(\"MEMGRAPH_USERNAME\", \"\")\npassword = os.environ.get(\"MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD\", \"\")\n\n#initialize memgraph connection\ngraph = MemgraphGraph(\n    url=url, username=username, password=password, refresh_schema=True\n)\n</pre> import os   from langchain_community.chains.graph_qa.memgraph import MemgraphQAChain from langchain_community.graphs import MemgraphGraph   url = os.environ.get(\"MEMGRAPH_URI\", \"bolt://localhost:7687\") username = os.environ.get(\"MEMGRAPH_USERNAME\", \"\") password = os.environ.get(\"MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD\", \"\")  #initialize memgraph connection graph = MemgraphGraph(     url=url, username=username, password=password, refresh_schema=True ) In\u00a0[4]: Copied! <pre>graph_text = \"\"\"\nJohn's title is Director of the Digital Marketing Group.

LangChain's <code>RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</code> takes a large text and splits it based on a specified chunk size using a predefined set of characters. In order, the default characters are:</p> <ul> <li>\"\\n\\n\" - two new line characters</li> <li>\"\\n\" - one new line character</li> <li>\" \" - a space</li> <li>\"\" - an empty character</li> </ul> <p>The process starts by attempting to split the text using the first character, \"\\n\\n.\" If the resulting chunks are still too large, it moves to the next character, \"\\n,\" and tries splitting again. This continues with each character in the set until the chunks are smaller than the specified chunk size. Since we already removed all the \"\\n\\n\" and \"\\n\" characters when we cleaned up the text, the <code>RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</code> will begin at the \" \"(space) character.</p> <p>We settled on a chunk size of 512 after experimenting with a chunk size of 1000. When the chunks were that large, our model was getting too much context for question-answering; this led to confused responses by the LLM because it was receiving too much information, so we changed it to smaller chunks. Feel free to experiment with chunk size further!</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n</pre> text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) <p>Next, we choose an embedding model to be trained on our ibm.com dataset. The trained embedding model is used to generate embeddings for each data point in the dataset. For text data, popular open-source embedding models include Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText or pre-trained transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa. OpenAIembeddings may also be used by leveraging the OpenAI embeddings API endpoint, the <code>langchain_openai</code> package and getting an <code>openai_api_key</code>, however, there is a cost associated with this usage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, because the embedding models are so large, vector embedding often demands significant computational resources.

However, these models may struggle to produce responses that are contextually relevant, factually accurate or up to date. The models may not know the latest information on IBM products. To tackle this knowledge gap, we can use methods such as fine-tuning or continued pre-training, but both can be expensive. Instead, we can use RAG to leverage a knowledge base of existing content.</p> <p>RAG applications address the knowledge gap limitation by incorporating a retrieval step before response generation. During retrieval, vector search can be used to identify contextually pertinent information, such as relevant information or documents from a large corpus of text, typically stored in a vector database. Finally, an LLM is used to generate a response based on the retrieved context.</p> <p>LangChain is a powerful, open-source framework that facilitates the development of applications using LLMs for various NLP tasks.

The functions in the <code>ReActAgent</code> class allow for iterative tool calling in response to the graph state.</p> <p>The <code>__init__</code> function  initializes the attributes of the class with the large language model, tools and system message as parameters. This constructor creates a state graph with nodes for the guardian model, LLM and tools. The graph start at the <code>guardian</code> node, which calls the <code>guardian_moderation</code> method to detect harmful content before it reaches the LLM and the database. The conditional edge between the <code>guardian</code> and <code>llm</code> nodes routes the state of the graph to either the <code>llm</code> node or the end. This is determined by the output of the <code>guardian_moderation</code> function. Safe messages are passed to the <code>llm</code> node, which executes the <code>call_llm</code> method. We also add a conditional edge between the <code>llm</code> and <code>tools</code> nodes to route messages appropriately. If the LLM returns a tool call, the <code>should_call_tools</code> method returns a <code>True</code> boolean. Otherwise, <code>False</code> is returned and the graph routes to the end. This step is part of the ReAct agent architecture\u2014we want the agent to receive the tool output and then react to the change in state to determine its next action.</p> <p>Next, we can compile the graph, which allows us to invoke the agent in a later step.

It involves structuring workflows where an AI agent, powered by artificial intelligence, acts as the central decision-maker or reasoning engine, orchestrating its actions based on inputs, context, and outputs from external systems. Using an orchestration framework, LLMs can seamlessly integrate with APIs, databases, and other AI applications, enabling functionalities such as chatbots and automation tools. Open-source agent frameworks further enhance the adaptability of these systems, making LLMs more effective in real-world scenarios.</p> <p>Many people misunderstand the difference between LLM Orchestration and LLM Agent Orchestration.

We\u2019ll explore how agents leverage key components such as memory, planning, and action to perform intelligent tasks. You\u2019ll also implement a practical system that processes text from a book, answers queries dynamically, and evaluates its performance using accuracy metrics like BLEU, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.</p> <p>The framework presented in figure-1 provides a holistic design for Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents, emphasizing the interplay between key components: Profile, Memory, Planning, and Action. Each component represents a critical stage in building an autonomous agent capable of reasoning, decision-making, and interacting with dynamic environments.[1]</p> In\u00a0[8]: Copied! <pre># ![LLM-Agent-Orchestration-Framework](./images/llm-agent-orchestration-1.png)\n\n# This code is used to only display the image.

This ensures the agent can interact in a personalized way. Profiles can be manually crafted, generated by Gen AI models like IBM\u00ae Granite\u2122 models or OpenAI\u2019s GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), or aligned with specific datasets to meet task requirements. Leveraging prompt engineering, profiles can be dynamically refined to optimize responses. Additionally, within multi-agent orchestration, the profile helps define roles and behaviors, ensuring seamless coordination across AI algorithms and decision-making systems.</p> <ol> <li>Memory: Storing and Using Context</li> </ol> <p>Memory helps the agent retain and retrieve past interactions, enabling contextual responses. It can be unified (all data in one place) or hybrid (structured and unstructured). Operations like reading, writing, and reflection allow the agent to learn from experience and provide consistent, informed outputs. Well-structured memory enhances multi-agent orchestration by ensuring that different agents, including specialized agents designed for a specific task, can share and retrieve relevant data efficiently. In frameworks like AutoGen and Crew AI, memory plays a crucial role in maintaining continuity within the ecosystem of collaborating agents, ensuring seamless coordination and optimized task execution.</p> <ol> <li>Planning: Strategizing Actions</li> </ol> <p>The planning component lets the agent devise strategies to achieve goals. It can follow predefined steps or adapt dynamically based on feedback from the environment, humans, or the LLM itself. By integrating AI algorithms and leveraging a knowledge base, planning can be optimized to improve reasoning efficiency and problem-solving accuracy. In LLM applications, planning plays a crucial role in ensuring natural language understanding and decision-making processes align with the agent's objectives. Additionally, retrieval-augmented techniques enhance the agent's ability to access relevant information dynamically, improving response accuracy. This flexibility ensures the agent remains effective in changing scenarios, especially in multi-agent orchestration, where various agents coordinate their plans to achieve complex objectives while maintaining scalability for handling large and diverse tasks.</p> <ol> <li>Action: Executing Decisions</li> </ol> <p>Actions are the agent\u2019s way of interacting with the world, whether by completing tasks, gathering information, or communicating. It uses memory and planning to guide execution, employs tools when needed, and adapts its internal state based on results for continuous improvement. Optimizing the action execution algorithm ensures efficiency, especially when integrating GPT-powered reasoning models and Gen AI techniques for real-time decision-making.</p> <p>By combining these components, the framework transforms LLMs into adaptable agents capable of reasoning, learning, and performing tasks autonomously. This modular design makes it ideal for applications like customer service, research assistance, and creative problem-solving.</p> <p>This tutorial demonstrates the creation of a Queryable Knowledge Agent designed to process large text documents (like books) and answer user queries accurately. Using IBM\u2019s Granite LLM and LangChain, the agent is built following the principles outlined in the framework for LLM-based autonomous agents. The framework's components align seamlessly with the agent's workflow to ensure adaptability and intelligent responses.</p> <p>Let's understand how the framework applies in our use case.</p> In\u00a0[11]: Copied! <pre># ![LLM-Agent-Orchestration-Framework](./images/llm-agent-orchestration-2.png)\n\n# This code is used to only display the image.

Its context is personalized to process a specific document (e.g., The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes).</p> <p>Memory: The agent employs hybrid memory by embedding chunks of the book into a FAISS vector store. This allows it to retrieve relevant context dynamically during queries. Memory operations like reading (retrieval) and writing (updating embeddings) ensure the agent can adapt to new queries over time.</p> <p>Planning: Query resolution involves single-path reasoning. The agent retrieves relevant chunks of text, generates answers using IBM\u2019s Granite LLM, and evaluates the output for accuracy. Planning without feedback ensures simplicity, while the system\u2019s modularity allows feedback loops to be incorporated in future iterations.</p> <p>Action: The agent executes query resolution by integrating memory retrieval and LLM processing. It completes tasks like generating answers, calculating accuracy metrics (BLEU, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score), and visualizing results for user interpretation. These outputs reflect the agent\u2019s capability to act intelligently based on reasoning and planning.</p> <p>You need an IBM Cloud account to create a watsonx.ai project.</p> <p>While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook.</p> <ol> <li>Log in to watsonx.ai using your IBM Cloud account.</li> <li>Create a watsonx.ai project.

He admires her abilities and considers her to be the superior of all women in his field. However, there is no romantic or emotional connection between them, as Holmes is not capable of feeling such emotions.

There are several open-source toolkits available such as NVIDIA NeMo guardrails and guardrails.ai. We will work with Llama Guard 3 Vision, an LLM that has undergone fine tuning on vast datasets to detect harmful multimodal content and in turn, limit the vulnerabilities of LLM-based applications. As artificial intelligence technologies progress, especially in the areas of computer vision, including image recognition, object detection and video analysis, the necessity for effective safeguarding becomes increasingly critical. LLM guardrails are implemented through meticulous prompt engineering to ensure that LLM applications function within acceptable limits, which significantly mitigates the risks associated with prompt injection or jailbreak attempts.</p> <p>In this regard, inaccuracies can have serious implications across various domains. Llama Guard 3 categorizes the following hazards:</p> <ul> <li><p>Violent crimes (S1): As an example, misidentifications in surveillance footage can lead to wrongful accusations, impacting innocent individuals and potentially undermining justice.</p> </li> <li><p>Nonviolent crimes (S2): For instance, flaws in facial recognition systems used in retail environments might falsely accuse customers of shoplifting, affecting their reputation and privacy.</p> </li> <li><p>Sex crimes (S3): In cases where inaccuracies arise, failing to identify individuals correctly in sensitive scenarios might impede law enforcement efforts, potentially allowing perpetrators to evade justice.</p> </li> <li><p>Child exploitation (S4): For example, a failure to accurately detect inappropriate content can lead to the dissemination of harmful material, putting children at risk.</p> </li> <li><p>Defamation (S5): Misinterpretation of images or video content can damage reputations for instance, false allegations against individuals or organizations might arise from faulty visual data.</p> </li> <li><p>Specialized advice (S6): In domains requiring expertise, such as medical imaging, inaccurate interpretations can lead to poor decisions regarding diagnosis or treatment.</p> </li> <li><p>Privacy (S7): Misuse of computer vision technology for unauthorized surveillance can violate individual\u2019s privacy rights and create ethical dilemma.</p> </li> <li><p>Intellectual property (S8): Errors in recognizing copyrighted content can result in unintentional violations, leading to legal ramifications.</p> </li> <li><p>Indiscriminate weapons (S9): Computer vision systems must accurately identify weapons to prevent wrongful actions or escalations in tense situations.</p> </li> <li><p>Hate (S10): Inflammatory content recognition is vital to prevent the spread of hate speech and maintain societal harmony.</p> </li> <li><p>Self-harm (S11): Detecting signs of self-harm or distress through visual data is crucial in providing timely support to individuals in need.</p> </li> <li><p>Sexual content (S12): The ability to accurately identify inappropriate or explicit material is essential to safeguard users, especially in platforms accessed by minors.</p> </li> <li><p>Elections (S13): Inaccurate visual data interpretation during elections can lead to misinformation, affecting public perception and the integrity of the voting process.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Llama Guard 3 Vision offers a comprehensive framework that provides the necessary constraints and validations tailored specifically for computer vision applications in real-time. Several validation methods exist. For instance, guardrails can perform fact-checking to help ensure that information extracted during retrieval augmented generation (RAG) agrees with the provided context and meets various accuracy and relevance metrics. Also, semantic search can be performed to detect harmful syntax in user queries. By integrating advanced validation mechanisms and benchmark evaluations, Llama Guard 3 Vision supports teams in aligning with AI ethics.</p> <p>For a description of each hazard, read the model card.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/llm-guardrails/#steps","title":"Steps\u00b6","text":"<p>Check out this IBM Technology YouTube video that walks you through the following set up instructions in steps 1 and 2.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/llm-guardrails/#step-1-set-up-your-environment","title":"Step 1.

This  allows LLMs to extend their functionality, enhancing their ability to handle real-world tasks that may require access to external data, real-time information, or specific applications. When an LLM uses a web search tool, it can call the web to fetch real-time data that aren't available in the model's training data. Other types of tools might include Python for calculations, data analysis, or visualization, or calling a service endpoint for data. Tool calling can make a chatbot more dynamic and adaptable, allowing it to provide more accurate, relevant, and detailed responses based on live data or specialized tasks outside its immediate knowledge base. Popular frameworks for tool-calling include Langchain and now ollama.</p> <p>Ollama is a platform that offers open-source, local AI models for use on personal devices so that users can run LLMs directly on their computers. Unlike a service like the OpenAI api, there\u2019s no need for an account since the model is on your local machine. Ollama focuses on privacy, performance, and ease of use, enabling users to access and interact with AI models without sending data to external servers. This can be particularly appealing for those concerned about data privacy or who want to avoid the reliance on external APIs. Ollama\u2019s platform is designed to be easy to set up and use, and it supports various models, giving users a range of tools for natural language processing, code generation, and other AI tasks directly on their own hardware. It is well suited to a tool calling architecture because it can access all the capabilities of a local environment including data, programs, and custom software.</p> <p>In this tutorial you'll learn how to set up tool calling by using ollama to look through a local filesystem, a task which would be difficult to do with a remote LLM. Many ollama models are available for tool calling and building AI agents like Mistral and Llama 3.2, a full list is available at https://ollama.com/library. In this case we'll use IBM Granite 3.3 Dense which has tool support.

This progress is most apparent in the newest 8B model\u2019s significantly improved performance on IFEval, a dataset featuring tasks that test a model\u2019s ability to follow detailed instructions, and Multi-step Soft Reasoning (MuSR), whose tasks measure reasoning and understanding on and of long texts.\\n\\r\\n        Expanded context length\\r\\n    \\nBolstering the performance leap from Granite 3.0 to Granite 3.1 is the expansion of all models\u2019 context windows. Granite 3.1\u2019s 128K token context length is on par with that of other leading open model series, including Llama 3.1\u20133.3 and Qwen2.5.\\nThe context window (or context length) of a large language model (LLM) is the amount of text, in tokens, that an LLM can consider at any one time. A larger context window enables a model to process larger inputs, carry out longer continuous exchanges and incorporate more information into each output. Tokenization doesn\u2019t entail any fixed token-to-word \u201cexchange rate,\u201d but 1.5 tokens per word is a useful estimate. 128K tokens is roughly equivalent to a 300-page book.\\nAbove a threshold of about 100K tokens, impressive new possibilities emerge, including multi-document question answering, repository-level code understanding, self-reflection and LLM-powered autonomous agents.1 Granite 3.1\u2019s expanded context length thus lends itself to a much wider range of enterprise use cases, from processing code bases and lengthy legal documents in their entirety to simultaneously reviewing thousands of financial transactions.\\n\\r\\n        Granite Guardian 3.1: detecting hallucinations in agentic workflows\\nGranite Guardian 3.1 8B and Granite Guardian 3.1 2B can now detect hallucinations that might occur in an agentic workflow, affording the same accountability and trust to function calling that we already provide for RAG.\\nMany steps and subprocesses occur in the space between the initial request sent to an AI agent and the output the agent eventually returns to the user. To provide oversight throughout, Granite Guardian 3.1 models monitor every function call for syntactic and semantic hallucinations.\\nFor instance, if an AI agent purportedly queries an external information source, Granite Guardian 3.1 monitors for fabricated information flows. If an agentic workflow entails intermediate calculations using figures retrieved from a bank record, Granite Guardian 3.1 checks to see whether the agent pulled the correct function call along with the appropriate numbers.\\nToday\u2019s release is yet another step toward accountability and trust for any component of an LLM-based enterprise workflow. The new Granite Guardian 3.1 models are available on Hugging Face. They\u2019ll also be available through Ollama later this month and on IBM watsonx.ai in January 2025.\\n\\r\\n        Granite embedding models\\r\\n    \\nEmbeddings are an integral part of the LLM ecosystem. An accurate and efficient means of representing words, queries and documents in numerical form is essential to an array of enterprise tasks including semantic search, vector search and RAG, as well as maintaining effective vector databases. An effective embedding model can significantly enhance a system\u2019s understanding of user intent and increase the relevance of information and sources in response to a query.\\nWhile the past two years have seen the proliferation of increasingly competitive open source autoregressive LLMs for tasks like text generation and summarization, open source embedding model releases from major providers are relatively few and far between.\\nThe new Granite Embedding models are an enhanced evolution of the Slate family of encoder-only, RoBERTA-based language models. Trained with the same care and consideration for filtering bias, hate, abuse and profanity (\u201cHAP\u201d) as the rest of the Granite series, Granite Embedding is offered in four model sizes, two of which support multilingual embedding across 12 natural languages:\\nGranite-Embedding-30M-EnglishGranite-Embedding-125M-EnglishGranite-Embedding-107M-MultilingualGranite-Embedding-278M-Multilingual')</pre> <p>We can also use the tokenizer for verifying our process and to check the number of tokens present in each chunk.

Today marks the release of IBM Granite 3.1, the latest update to our Granite series of open, performant, enterprise-optimized language models. This suite of improvements, additions and new capabilities focuses primarily on augmenting performance, accuracy and accountability in essential enterprise use cases like tool use, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and scalable agentic AI workflows. Granite 3.1 builds upon the momentum of the recently launched Granite 3.0 collection. IBM will continue to release updated models and functionality for the Granite 3 series in the coming months, with new multimodal capabilities slated for release in Q1 2025. These new Granite models are not the only notable recent IBM contributions to the open source LLM ecosystem. Today\u2019s release caps off a recent run of innovative open source launches, from a flexible framework for developing AI agents to an intuitive toolkit to unlock essential information stashed away in PDFs, slide decks and other file formats that are difficult for models to digest. Using these tools and frameworks in tandem with Granite 3.1 models offers developers evolved capabilities for RAG, AI agents and other LLM-based workflows.

All the models are publicly released under an Apache 2.0 license for both research and commercial use. The models\\' data curation and training procedure were designed for enterprise usage and customization, with a process that evaluates datasets for governance, risk and compliance (GRC) criteria, in addition to IBM\\'s standard data clearance process and document quality checks.\\n\\nGranite 3.1 language models extend the context length of Granite 3.0 language models from 4K to 128K using a progressive training strategy by increasing the supported context length in increments while adjusting RoPE theta until the models successfully adapt to the desired length of 128K. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 500B tokens. Moreover, Granite 3.1 instruction models provide an improved developer experience for function-calling and RAG generation tasks.\\n\\nGranite 3.1 models come in 4 varying sizes and 2 architectures:\\n- Dense Models: 2B and 8B parameter models, trained on 12 trillion tokens in total.\\n- Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) Models: Sparse 1B and 3B MoE models, with 400M and 800M activated parameters respectively, trained on 10 trillion tokens in total.\\n\\nAccordingly, these options provide a range of models with different compute requirements to choose from, with appropriate trade-offs with their performance on downstream tasks. At each scale, we release base model \u00e2\u20ac\u201d checkpoints of models after pretraining, as well as instruct checkpoints \u00e2\u20ac\u201d models finetuned for dialogue, instruction-following, helpfulness, and safety.\\n\\nEvaluation results show that Granite-3.1-8B-Instruct outperforms models of similar parameter sizes in [Hugging Face\\'s OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/) (see Figure 1). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Figure 1.

To emphasize the importance of chunking, it is helpful to understand RAG. RAG is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that combines information retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to retrieve relevant information from supplemental datasets to optimize the quality of the LLM\u2019s output. To manage large documents, we can use chunking to split the text into smaller snippets of meaningful chunks. These text chunks can then be embedded and stored in a vector database through the use of an embedding model. Finally, the RAG system can then uses semantic search to retrieve only the most relevant chunks. Smaller chunks tend to outperform larger chunks as they tend to be more manageable pieces for models of smaller context window size.</p> <p>Some key components of chunking include:</p> <ul> <li>Chunking strategy: Choosing the right chunking strategy for your RAG application is important as it determines the boundaries for setting chunks. We will explore some of these in the next section.</li> <li>Chunk size: Maximum number of tokens to be in each chunk. Determining the appropriate chunk size usually involves some experimenting.</li> <li>Chunk overlap: The number of tokens overlapping between chunks to preserve context. This is an optional parameter.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/rag-chunking-strategies/#choosing-the-right-chunking-strategy-for-your-rag-application","title":"Choosing the right chunking strategy for your RAG application\u00b6","text":"<p>There are several different chunking strategies to choose from. It is important to select the most effective chunking technique for the specific use case of your LLM application. Some commonly used chunking processes include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Fixed-size chunking: Splitting text based on a chunk size and optional chunk overlap. This approach is most common and straightforward.</p> </li> <li><p>Recursive chunking: Iterating default separators until one of them produces the preferred chunk size. Default separators include <code>[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]</code>. This chunking method uses hierarchical separators so that paragraphs, followed by sentences and then words, are kept together as much as possible.</p> </li> <li><p>Semantic chunking: Splitting text in a way that groups sentences based on the semantic similarity of their embeddings. Embeddings of high semantic similarity are closer together than those of low semantic similarity. This results in context-aware chunks.</p> </li> <li><p>Document-based chunking: Splitting based on document structure. This splitter can utilize Markdown text, images, tables and even Python code classes and functions as ways of determining structure. In doing so, large documents can be chunked and processed by the LLM.</p> </li> <li><p>Agentic chunking: Leverages agentic AI by allowing the LLM to determine appropriate document splitting based on semantic meaning as well as content structure such as paragraph types, section headings, step-by-step instructions and more.

To generate the ground truths for each question, the user might have manually created them or generated them using an LLM with the appropriate prompt template. These responses are deemed as the ideal answers and are stored in the <code>ground_truth</code> column. Lastly, a RAG pipeline was used to generate the answers seen in the answer column. When building the RAG pipeline, the external knowledge base was vectorized. Then, when querying the RAG system, the relevant chunks of text that the LLM used for generating each answer were obtained from the vector store by using a similarity algorithm such as the top-k retrieval algorithm.

In traditional language generation tasks, large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or IBM\u00ae Granite\u2122 Models are used to construct responses based on an input prompt. Common real-world use cases of these large language models are chatbots. These models struggle to produce responses that are contextually relevant, factually accurate or up to date.</p> <p>RAG applications address this limitation by incorporating a retrieval step before response generation. During retrieval, additional text fragments relevant to the prompt are pulled from a knowledge base, such as relevant documents from a large corpus of text, typically stored in a vector database. Finally, an LLM is used for generating responses based on the original prompt augmented with the retrieved context.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/rag-evaluation-ragas/#overview-of-rag-evaluation","title":"Overview of RAG evaluation\u00b6","text":"<p>There are many different RAG evaluation frameworks and evaluation metrics. Apart from Ragas, other frameworks include IBM's unitxt and OpenAI's Evals. Unlike the other frameworks, Ragas uses another LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the performance of a RAG pipeline.</p> <p>There are several evaluation metrics available for measuring the performance of our RAG pipeline. The metrics we will be using in the open source Ragas framework can be split into two parts:</p> <ul> <li><p>Generation evaluation</p> <ul> <li><p>Faithfulness measures if all generated answers can be inferred from the retrieved context.</p> </li> <li><p>Answer relevancy measures the relevancy of the generated response to the question.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li><p>Retrieval evaluation</p> <ul> <li><p>Context precision measures the ranking of ground-truth relevant entities in the context. Higher context precision means ground-truth relevant items are ranked higher than \u201cnoise.\u201d</p> </li> <li><p>Context recall measures the extent to which the LLM\u2019s generated answers to user queries can be found in the retrieved context.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>These metrics are meant to be subjective proxies for how well a RAG pipeline retrieves relevant information from its knowledge base to form a response. It is important to note, there is no ideal for data, prompts or LLMs. Even context that has a low scoring <code>context_relevance</code> is not necessarily bad context. The low score might be due to some amount of \"noise,\" or less relevant information, or simply because the task itself is open to multiple interpretations. Noise is not necessarily bad either. We, as humans, produce a certain amount of noise in our responses while also being intelligible in answering questions.</p> <p>There are also biases that affect the evaluation of a RAG pipeline such as preference for either shorter or longer responses, otherwise known as length bias. This type of bias can lead to one response being evaluated higher than another because of its length and not its substance.</p> <p>For these reasons, it is best practice to perform multiple evaluations. This exercise can be accomplished through changing the LLM's prompt template, metrics, sequence of evaluation, and more. If you are creating your own data set for your RAG pipeline, it is also recommended to use different models for the LLM generating the responses and the LLM critiquing the responses. If the same model is used for both, then there is greater potential for self-evaluation bias. Because these evaluation metrics are subjective, the results produced by these frameworks should also be checked by human judges.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we do not create a RAG system.

For our experiment, we'll use a second subset of our dataset as the ground truth and we'll compare the predicted values to the actual values in this ground truth subset.</p> <p>Granite timeseries models come in different context lengths of 512, 1024 and 1536 tokens. The context length describes the amount of information the model can consider when making a single prediction. For the Granite timeseries models, each row in a dataset counts as one token towards the context length. We'll be using the 512 token context length timeseries model, <code>ibm/granite-ttm-512-96-r2</code>, in our experiment. In order to do this, we need a dataset of 512 rows to provide as input to the model, our historical data. We'll term this input dataset as <code>data</code>. We have many more rows in our dataset than are needed for this prediction problem. In this case, to subset the data, we'll simply take the most recent timestamps or the last rows of the dataset.</p> <p>The second dataset we need is our evaluation or ground truth dataset. We'll use the last 96 rows of data in our dataset for this purpose. We'll call this <code>future_context</code> and we'll use this data to compare against our predictions.</p> <p>Here, we also specify the columns to be used for prediction. The identifiers <code>timestamp_column</code> and <code>target_column</code> set these values for the model.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/time-series-forecasting-api/#step-5-select-a-granite-timeseries-foundation-model-from-watsonxai","title":"Step 5.

This is an application of zero-shot learning (ZSL) which is a machine learning method that relies on the pre-trained models\u2019 ability to recognize and categorize objects or concepts on post-training. ZSL is similar to few-shot learning (FSL), the ability for a model to make an accurate prediction by training on a small number of labeled examples. Both techniques are used to enable models to perform tasks that they haven\u2019t been explicitly trained on.</p> <p>Researchers have been experimenting with machine learning models for classification tasks since the 50\u2019s. The Perceptron is an early classification model that uses a decision-boundary to classify data into different groups. Most ML/DL methods rely on supervised learning techniques, and therefore need to be trained using a large amount of task-specific labeled training data. This presents a challenge as the large, annotated datasets required to train these models simply do not exist for every domain. Some researchers motivated by these constraints say that LLMs are the way around these data limitations.</p> <p>LLMs are designed to perform natural language processing (NLP) and natural language inferencing (NLI) tasks which gives them a natural ability to perform zero-shot text classification. The model can generate data based on semantic descriptions because it\u2019s trained on a large corpus of data. Like LLMs, foundation models use a transformer architecture that enables them to classify labels without any specific training data for a classification task. This is possible because of the models\u2019 ability to perform self-supervised learning and transfer learning to classify data into unseen classes. To the advantage of data science, this approach eliminates the requirement for large datasets with human-annotated labels because it automates the preprocessing portion of the classification pipeline.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/zero-shot-classification/#how-foundation-models-perform-zero-shot-classification","title":"How foundation models perform zero-shot classification\u00b6","text":"<p>Foundation models are built on the transformer architecture that that can take raw text at scale through its attention mechanism, and understand how words relate to each other to form a statistical representation of language. The transformer is a type of neural network architecture designed to interpret meaningful representations of sequences or collections of data points. This capability is the reason why these models perform so well on NLP tasks.</p> <p>The transformer model architecture includes an encoder-decoder structure and self-attention mechanism that allows the model to draw connections between input and output using an auto-regressive prediction. The encoder processes the tokenized input data into embeddings that represent the data in a format the model can read. The decoder interprets the embeddings to generate an output. The self-attention mechanism computes the weights for each word, or token, in sentence based on its relationship to every other word in the sentence. This allows the model to take the semantic and syntactic relationships between words. The self-attention mechanism is integral for entailment, a NLI task that heavily relies on the self-attention mechanism because it helps the model understand the context within text data.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/zero-shot-classification/#what-models-are-best-for-zero-shot-classification","title":"What models are best for zero-shot classification?\u00b6","text":"<p>Choosing the right model for your zero-shot classification depends on your classification task. It\u2019s no surprise that there is an abundance to choose from, let\u2019s consider three types of models:</p> <ul> <li><p>Zero-shot classification model is a type of model that can classify data into categories without task-specific labeled examples during the prediction phase. The models rely on training data, which is normally a large-scale, general dataset to classify new, unseen classes. One of the most popular zero-shot classification models for zero-shot text classification is HuggingFace\u2019s facebook/bart-large-mnli model based on the BART-large transformer model architecture. Zero-shot classification models perform well on generalized tasks but, because there is no fine-tuning on specific tasks or datasets, accuracy may be limited. Because of this limitation, the model requires well-formulated prompts.</p> </li> <li><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and BERT are designed to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks. This can limit use cases using multimodal datasets such as images and audio. These models are designed to handle text data, often using deep learning architectures likes transformers. LLMs are trained on a large corpora of text data, giving them extensive knowledge of language, syntax, semantics, and some domain-specific knowledge. These models generally perform well with little to no task-specific fine-tuning, making them suitable for zero-shot and few-shot classification scenarios. Due to their generalized training, LLMs may have limited accuracy for specialized tasks especially ones that require domain specific data. These models are best to work with when the dataset is text-based.</p> </li> <li><p>Foundation models are multimodal, meaning they are often trained on a myriad of modalities including text, images, and speech. These models are generally versatile and after pretraining can undergo optimization for many different tasks. IBM\u2019s Granite (TM) Models classify data by using a large language model (LLM) trained on a curated dataset of business-relevant information, including legal, financial, and technical domains, which allows it to analyze text and identify patterns to categorize data into specific classes based on the context and semantic meaning within the text. Because of their multimodal capacity, these types of models can handle image and text classification. These models are ideal when you need a broad range of capabilities or want to handle multiple types of data for instance, image or audio classification.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/zero-shot-classification/#use-cases","title":"Use cases\u00b6","text":"<ul> <li><p>Image classification \u2013 Computer vision is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows uses machine learning models to analyze images and videos. A crucial task within computer vision is image classification, which involves labeling and categorizing groups of pixels within an image. Image classification is used in many domains such as social media for photo tagging, self-driving cars, and even healthcare.</p> </li> <li><p>Text classification \u2013 NLP utilizes text classification to enable the models understanding of human language. Text classification is used for many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, similarity scoring, key phrase detection and much more. A popular use case, and one we\u2019ll be exploring in this tutorial, is for customer service analysis.</p> </li> <li><p>Audio Classification \u2013 The goal of audio classification is to use the model to recognize and distinguish between audio recordings so that it can perform sound categorization.

LLaMa Factory supports several different types of training. Some of the most commonly used are:</p> <p>Pre-Training: where a model undergoes initial training using an extensive dataset to generate responses to fundamental language and ideas. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): where a model receives additional training with annotated data to enhance precision for a particular function or on a specific topic. Reward Modeling: where the model acquires knowledge on how to achieve a specific incentive or reward that will inform its output Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Training: is a reinforcement learning (RL) technique where the model is further honed through policy gradient techniques to boost its effectiveness in a specific setting.</p> <p>There are many settings used in configuring LoRA but a few of the most commonly used are:</p> <p>Learning Rate (LR): the learning rate determines how significantly model parameters are updated during each iteration of training. A higher LR can speed up convergence by allowing larger updates but risks overshooting the optimal solution or oscillating around it. A lower LR leads to slower but more stable convergence, reducing the risk of instability near the optimal solution.</p> <p>loraplus_lr_ratio: this sets the the ratio of learning rates. Generally it should be &gt; 1, but the optimal choice of loraplus_lr_ratio is model and task dependent. As a rule of thumb, loraplus_lr_ratio should be larger when the task is more difficult and the model needs to update its features to learn well. In this case, it helps to make the learning rate slightly smaller (e.g., by a factor of 2) than typical vanilla LoRA learning rates.</p> <p>Effective Batch Size: Correctly configuring your batch size is critical for balancing training stability with the VRAM limitations of the GPU you're using. The Effective Batch Size is set by the product of <code>per_device_train_batch_size</code> * <code>gradient_accumulation_steps</code>. A larger Effective Batch Size generally leads to smoother, more stable training, but also may require more VRAM than your GPU contains. A smaller Effective Batch Size may introduce more variance.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/generative-ai/lora_on_watsonx/lora-training/#infer-with-the-granite-base-model","title":"Infer with the Granite Base Model\u00b6","text":"<p>Now it's time to run inference.

Large transformer-based models such as LLMs often require significant GPU resources to run. In turn, a quantized model can allow you to run machine learning inference on limited GPUs or even on a CPU. Frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite (tflite) can run quantized TensorFlow models on edge devices including phones or microcontrollers. In the era of larger and larger LLMs, quantization is an essential technique during the training, fine tuning and inference stages of modeling. Quantization is especially helpful for users who want to run models locally on limited hardware machines. Low-resource hardware that has a hardware machine learning accelerator can also run quantized models very efficiently.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/instructional-guides/post-training-quantization/#quantization-methods","title":"Quantization methods","text":"<p>Quantization is the process of mapping input values from a large set of continuous elements to a smaller set with a finite number of elements. Quantization methods have evolved rapidly and been an area of active research. For instance, a simple algorithm might be integer quantization, which is simply scaling 32-bit floating point (f32) numbers to 8-bit integers (int8). This technique is often called zero-point quantization. More sophisticated techniques use FP8, an 8-bit floating point with a dynamic range that can be set by the user. In this tutorial, we'll use k-means quantization to create very small models. That saves us from needing to do model calibration or the time-intensive step of creating an importance matrix that defines the importance of each activation in the neural network.</p> <p>We'll focus on post training quantization (PTQ) which focuses on decreasing the precision (and thus resource demands) after the model is trained. Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a common quantization technique for mitigating model accuracy and perplexity degradation that arises from quantization but is a more advanced technique with more limited use cases. In particular, we'll use k-means quantization via llama.cpp, an open source library that quantizes PyTorch models.</p> <p>When working with LLMs, model quantization allows us to convert high-precision floating-point numbers in the neural network layers to low-precision numbers that consume much less space. We'll be converting models to GPT-Generated Unified Format (GGUF) to run them efficiently in constrained resource scenarios. GGUF is a binary format optimized for quick loading and saving of models that makes it efficient for inference purposes. It achieves this efficiency by combining the model parameters (weights and biases) with more metadata for effective execution. Because it\u2019s compatible with various programming languages such as Python and R and supports fine tuning so users can adapt LLMs to specialized applications, it has become a popular format.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we\u2019ll quantize the IBM\u00ae Granite-3.0-8B-Instruct model in a few different ways to show the size of the models and compare how they perform on a task.

The long sleeves offer some protection against cooler morning temperatures.\n\n2. **Pants**: Khaki pants with a buttoned waistband and a button closure at the front (file: 'image7.jpeg')\n   - Khaki is a versatile choice that can match the casual vibe and also provide a nice balance with the plaid shirt. It's practical and comfortable for walking around.\n\n3. **Shoes**: A pair of tan leather boots with a chunky sole and high-top design (file: 'image3.jpeg')\n   - Tan leather boots offer a stylish yet comfortable option. The chunky sole provides good grip and support, ideal for navigating park trails or uneven ground. \n\nThis combination provides a relaxed, put-together look suitable for a casual morning outing, while also considering comfort and practicality.\n</pre> <p>With this generated outfit description, we can also display the clothing items that the model recommends!

Agentic architectures are structured around two different systems: single and multiagent.</p> <p>Single agent systems are best for solving narrow problems because they depend on one LLM agent to perform generative AI tasks. For example, a single chatbot agent can be focused on specific tasks or conversations that it can complete within the scope of its individual capabilities.</p> <p>Multiagent systems (MAS) are frameworks that orchestrate the functionality and interactions between AI agents. Rather than attempting to encompass all capabilities within a single agent, multiagent architectures use different agents to work within the same environment to achieve a shared goal.

Generative AI agents use the advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques of large language models (LLMs) to comprehend and respond to user inputs step-by-step and determine when to call on external tools. A core component of AI agents is reasoning. Upon acquiring new information through tool calling, human intervention or other agents, the reasoning paradigm guides the agent\u2019s next steps. </p> <p>With each action and each tool response, the ReAct (Reasoning and Action) paradigm instructs agents to \"think\" and plan their next steps. This step-by-step, slow reasoning, gives us insight into how the agent uses updated context to formulate conclusions. Because this process of reflection is continuous, it is often referred to as a think-act-observe loop and is a form of chain-of-thought prompting.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/projects/react-agent-tutorial/#using-langgraph-to-build-react-agents","title":"Using LangGraph to build ReAct agents","text":"<p>This tutorial will use the LangGraph framework, an open source AI agent framework designed to build, deploy and manage complex generative AI agent workflows. The prebuilt <code>create_react_agent</code> function provided by LangGraph is an easy way to build a simple, custom agent. Simple ReAct agents, like the one in this tutorial as depicted in Figure 1, are composed of two nodes. One node is responsible for calling the model and the other node is for using tools. Common tools include the prebuilt LangChain Wikipedia tool, DuckDuckGoSearchRun tool and even retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In cases with complex action input, another node can be added, as seen in Figure 2. This additional node would serve the purpose of helping ensure the agent returns structured output. </p> <p></p> <p>Within LangGraph, the \u201cstate\u201d feature serves as a memory bank that records and tracks all the valuable information processed by each iteration of the AI system. These stateful graphs allow agent's to recall past information and valuable context. The cyclic structure of the ReAct graph is leveraged when the outcome of one step depends on previous steps in the loop. The nodes, or \"actors,\" in the graph encode agent logic and are connected by edges.

Since you're looking for a cardio workout, I'll focus on the equipment that falls under the 'cardio' or 'cardio' category. Here's a suggested workout:\n\n**Warm-up (5 minutes)**\n\n* Start with the 'rowing machine' (image2.jpeg) for 5 minutes to get your heart rate up and loosen your muscles.\n\n**Cardio Circuit (30 minutes)**\n\n* Move to the 'treadmill' (image1.jpeg) and set it to a walk or jog at a moderate pace. Spend 10 minutes on the treadmill to get your heart rate up and get some cardio benefits.\n* Next, head to the 'elliptical trainer' (image0.jpeg) and spend 10 minutes on it, taking your heart rate to a moderate level. You can adjust the resistance to make it more challenging.\n* Finally, hop on the 'exercise bike' (image6.jpeg) for 10 minutes to get some more cardio action.\n\n**High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) (20 minutes)**\n\n* Move to the 'Stairmaster' (image10.jpeg) and spend 5 minutes warming up at a moderate pace.\n* Then, increase the resistance and sprint for 2 minutes at maximum intensity.\n* Reduce the intensity and recover for 2 minutes. Repeat for a total of 15-20 minutes.\n\n**Cool-down (5 minutes)**\n\n* Finish your workout with some light stretching on the 'yoga mat' (image3.jpeg) to help prevent muscle soreness.\n\nHere's your workout schedule:\n\n1. Warm-up on the 'rowing machine' (image2.jpeg) (5 minutes)\n2. Cardio circuit:\n\t* Treadmill (10 minutes)\n\t* Elliptical trainer (image0.jpeg) (10 minutes)\n\t* Exercise bike (image6.jpeg) (10 minutes)\n3. HIIT on the Stairmaster (image10.jpeg) (20 minutes)\n4. Cool-down with stretching (5 minutes)\n\nThis workout should get your heart rate up and provide a great cardio session for beginners. Remember to listen to your body and adjust the intensity and duration according to your needs.\n\nExample Output:\n```\n**Beginner Cardio Workout**\n\nWarm-up (5 minutes):\n- Rowing machine (image2.jpeg)\n\nCardio Circuit (30 minutes):\n- Treadmill (image1.jpeg) - 10 minutes\n- Elliptical trainer (image0.jpeg) - 10 minutes\n- Exercise bike (image6.jpeg) - 10 minutes\n\n**Cool-down (5 minutes)**\n- Static stretches on the yoga mat (image3.jpeg)\n```\n</pre> <p>Great! This personal training algorithm returned a well-described cardio workout plan including the number of repetitions, or reps, and rest time. The LLM also places importance on proper form and hydration.</p> <p>With this generated workout description, we can also display the gym equipment that the model recommends. To do so, we can simply extract the filenames. In case the model mentions the same filename twice, it is important to check whether the image has not already been displayed as we iterate the list of images. We can do so by storing displayed images in the <code>selected_items</code> list.

Without this setup, running `app.py` will result in a\n`TemplateNotFound` error because Flask looks for templates in a `templates`\nfolder by default.\n\n## Step 8: Instructions for Fixing\nTo fix this, create a new directory named `templates` in the same directory\nwhere `app.py`\n\n</code></pre> <p>The Programmer agent responds with the corrected code during the next <code>CodeReviewModification</code> phase:</p> <pre><code>/* bookstore-site_DefaultOrganization_20250506162935.log */\n\nHere is the list of your developed codes: main.py, index.html, about.html, products.html.\n\n### main.py\n```python\n...\n\n### templates/index.html\n\n```html\n&lt;!--\nHomepage template for Turn the Page bookstore website.\nProvides navigation links to other pages.\n--&gt;\n...\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n### templates/about.html\n```html\n&lt;!--  About page template for Turn the Page bookstore website.\nProvides information about the bookstore and navigation links. --&gt;\n\u2026\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The Code Reviewer and Programmer either continue refining the code for up to 10 iterations or until consensus is reached after two consecutive, identical modification phases.  </p> <p>The communication dehallucination pattern ensures that the final code is accurate, complete, and aligned with the intended requirements through iterative refinement, while also facilitating the effective completion of subtasks.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/projects/chatdev_watsonx_tutorial_/chatdev_watsonx/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>In this tutorial, we explored how ChatDev enables collaborative AI by simulating a virtual software company composed of role-based AI agents. Using the IBM\u00ae watsonx.ai\u00ae API as the model backend, ChatDev guides agents through the software development lifecycle using structured communication in both natural and programming languages.</p> <p>Although ChatDev doesn\u2019t use a formal agent communication protocol, it achieves agent interoperability from the LLM\u2019s natural abilities with agent communication techniques like ChatChain, inception prompting, and communicative dehallucination. This highlights the importance of orchestrating effective agent communication for successful collaboration and improve output quality.</p> <p>With built-in visualization tools for monitoring and replaying agent interactions, ChatDev provides a powerful platform for studying multi-agent workflows and the dynamics of LLM-driven teamwork. It demonstrates the real-world potential of Collaborative AI in software creation and beyond.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/projects/chatdev_watsonx_tutorial_/chatdev_watsonx/#footnotes","title":"Footnotes","text":"<p>[1] Qian, Chen, Wei Liu, Hongzhang Liu, Nuo Chen, Yufan Dang, Jiahao Li, Cheng Yang et al. \"Chatdev: Communicative agents for software development.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.07924 (2023).</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/projects/chatdev_watsonx_tutorial_/run/","title":"Run","text":"In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre># =========== Copyright 2023 @ CAMEL-AI.org.

This includes logic for interacting with a LLM, conversation history, and handling memory and token limits. critic_agent.py \u2013 this filedefines the CriticAgent class, (extends the ChatAgent class); The critic agent is designed to assist in evaluating and selecting an option from a set of proposals. It provides functionality for presenting options, parsing responses, and handling retries if the critic fails to make a valid choice. role_playing.py \u2013 this file defines the RolePlaying class, which facilitates role-playing interactions between two agents and an optional \u201ccritic in the loop.\u201d This file, role_playing.py, defines the <code>RolePlaying</code> class, which facilitates role-playing interactions between two agents (an assistant and a user) and optionally includes a critic in the loop. It is designed to simulate structured conversations where agents take on specific roles and interact based on predefined prompts and tasks.</p> <p>Misc Configuration configs.py \u2013 defines the ChatGPTConfig class generators.py \u2013 defines several classes that generate system messages This file, generators.py, defines several classes that generate system messages, role names, and task prompts for various scenarios in the CAMEL framework. These generators are used to create structured inputs for agents, enabling them to perform tasks, simulate role-playing, or interact in predefined contexts. human.py \u2013 defines the Human class, representing a human user interacting with the system. This file, human.py, defines the <code>Human</code> class, which represents a human user interacting with the system. It provides functionality for displaying options to the user, collecting their input, and processing their choices.

In this project, we use deepseek-r1, a performant base model ideal for automating product documentation.</p> <p>Here\u2019s why DeepSeek stands out for building PRDs with a multi-agent system like MetaGPT:</p> <ul> <li>Structured output for automation: DeepSeek models generate consistent markdown output,  which aligns well with workflows that require formal document structures such as PRDs or technical specs.</li> <li>Reasoning capabilities: The model supports multi-agent interaction loops by handling sequential reasoning and revision steps.</li> <li>Performance benchmarks: According to published benchmarks, DeepSeek\u2019s models perform competitively with other open-source models in the 7\u201313B parameter range, including those from Mistral, LLaMA, and IBM\u2019s Granite models. Granite, developed by IBM Research, is designed for enterprise-grade use cases, with a strong emphasis on governance, robustness, and structured business reasoning</li> <li>Local inference: Running deepseek-r1 via Ollama on local GPUs enables lower-latency experimentation without relying on external APIs like OpenAI or Microsoft Azure endpoints (no need for an API key!). This can be useful for workflows requiring data privacy or offline development.</li> <li>Language support and context window: DeepSeek offers strong multilingual support, including Chinese, and includes a reasonably long context window, which supports extended memory across multi-agent sessions.</li> <li>While DeepSeek is used in this tutorial, the same multi-agent system can be configured to run with other LLMs compatible with Ollama, Hugging Face, or OpenAI\u2019s API. The choice of model depends on the trade-off between reasoning accuracy, output structure, resource availability, and intended deployment environment.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/projects/metagpt_tutorial/metagpt_ollama_tutorial/#how-does-metagpt-work","title":"How does MetaGPT work?","text":"<p>MetaGPT uses the concept of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to align human and AI collaboration by structuring workflows based on real-world teams (i.e. a software company, or product development team).  </p> <p>A SOP provides detailed, step-by-step guidelines for completing a specific task or process.

If the same input (prompt) is encountered again, rather than making a new API call, the application will retrieve the previously stored response in the prompt cache.</p> <p>Think of prompt caching as a kind of \"memory\" for your application. The system keeps results from previous queries in order to save computation time by not having to make repeated requests against the same input.</p> <p>Prompt caching is significant because it avoids repeated API calls by reusing existing responses for identical repeated prompts, which results in faster response time, consistent output, and lower usage of the API, which is helpful for staying within rate limits. This also helps to scale the flow, and create resilience during outages.

It involves linking multiple prompts in a logical sequence, where the output of one prompt serves as the input for the next. This modular approach is powerful for solving complex tasks like multi-step text processing, summarization, question-answering, and more.</p> <p>LangChain is a versatile framework designed to simplify the creation of such workflows. It provides tools to manage LLMs such as IBM\u00ae Granite\u2122 models or OpenAI\u2019s GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models, define custom prompts, and connect them into reusable chains. By abstracting the complexity of managing prompts, LangChain allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than orchestrating interactions with LLMs.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we will:</p> <ol> <li>Explore different types of prompt chaining (Sequential, Branching, Iterative, etc.).</li> <li>Implement a generic chaining example combining Sequential, Branching, and Iterative chaining types.</li> <li>Leverage LangChain's built-in classes like <code>PromptTemplate</code>, <code>LLMChain</code>, and <code>SequentialChain</code> to define and manage the workflow.</li> </ol> <p>LangChain provides a powerful framework for building modular workflows in chatbot applications. By combining structured prompts, dynamic chaining, and advanced LLM integration, it allows developers to create scalable, adaptive pipelines that leverage RAG techniques and deliver structured outputs like JSON. Here's how LangChain handles prompt chaining effectively:</p> <p>Prompt Abstraction: LangChain leverages <code>from_template</code> to design structured input-output workflows for each step, making it easy to handle complex chatbot operations.</p> <p>LLM Integration: The framework seamlessly integrates with various LLMs, such as, IBM Granite, OpenAI and Hugging Face, enabling fine-tuning for customized tasks.</p> <p>Chain Management: LangChain's <code>SequentialChain</code> and <code>SimpleSequentialChain</code> enable modular workflows for chatbot pipelines, while <code>stroutputparser</code> ensures structured outputs like JSON.</p> <p>Dynamic Workflows: Using tools like <code>ConditionalChain</code> and <code>systemmessage</code> templates, LangChain supports adaptive workflows, aligning with the principles of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for dynamic content generation.</p> In\u00a0[3]: Copied! <pre>from IPython.display import Image, display\ndisplay(Image(filename='/Users/vrundagadesha/Tutorials/prompt-chaining-langchain-v1.png', embed=True))\n</pre> from IPython.display import Image, display display(Image(filename='/Users/vrundagadesha/Tutorials/prompt-chaining-langchain-v1.png', embed=True)) <p>By the end of this tutorial, you\u2019ll have a solid understanding of how to use LangChain to build modular and extensible workflows for a wide range of applications.</p> <p>Prompt chaining allows you to design workflows where outputs from one step are passed to the next. Different types of chaining support diverse workflows, ranging from simple sequential tasks to more complex, dynamic processes. Here\u2019s a brief look at the types of prompt chaining:</p> <ul> <li>Sequential Chaining: The most straightforward type of chaining, where the output of one prompt is directly passed as input to the next. This is ideal for tasks with a linear progression.<sup>[1]</sup></li> <li>Branching Chaining: In branching chaining, a single output is split into multiple parallel workflows. Each branch processes the output independently. <sup>[2]</sup></li> <li>Iterative Chaining: Iterative chaining involves repeatedly running a prompt or chain until a specified condition is met. This is useful for refining outputs.<sup>[3]</sup></li> <li>Hierarchical Chaining: This type breaks down a large task into smaller subtasks, which are executed hierarchically. Lower-level outputs feed higher-level tasks. <sup>[4]</sup></li> <li>Conditional Chaining: Conditional chaining dynamically chooses the next step based on the output of a prior prompt. It enables decision-making within workflows.</li> <li>Multi-Modal Chaining: Multi-modal chaining integrates prompts that handle different data types (e.g., text, images, or audio). It is suitable for applications combining multiple modalities. <sup>[2]</sup></li> <li>Dynamic Chaining: Dynamic chaining adapts the workflow based on real-time outputs or changing conditions. It adds flexibility to prompt chaining. <sup>[5]</sup></li> <li>Recursive Chaining: In recursive chaining, large inputs are divided into smaller chunks for individual processing, and the results are then combined. It is useful for handling lengthy documents or datasets. <sup>[6]</sup></li> <li>Reverse Chaining: Reverse chaining starts with a desired output and works backward to determine the necessary inputs or steps to achieve it. It is great for problem-solving and debugging. <sup>[5]</sup></li> </ul> <p>Each type of chaining caters to unique use cases, making it essential to choose the right one based on the task's complexity and requirements.</p> <p>In this workflow, we process customer feedback with chat models and prompt engineering to build a scalable text-processing pipeline. The following stages of the tutorial demonstrate sequential, branching, and iterative chaining techniques powered by generative AI.</p> <p>Extracting Keywords (Sequential Chaining)</p> <ul> <li>The input text or user input given in natural language is processed through a prompt template to identify significant keywords.</li> <li>This step uses sequential chaining to ensure the extracted keywords feed directly into subsequent tasks.</li> </ul> <p>Generating a Sentiment Summary (Branching Chaining)</p> <ul> <li>Extracted keywords are passed into a chat model to generate a sentiment summary.</li> <li>Branching chaining allows parallel paths for summarization to adapt outputs based on the context.</li> </ul> <p>Refining the Sentiment Summary (Iterative Chaining)</p> <ul> <li>If the sentiment summary doesn\u2019t meet predefined quality criteria, it is passed through a refinement prompt.</li> <li>Iterative chaining enables reprocessing until the output meets the desired level of precision.</li> </ul> <p>Final Output</p> <ul> <li>The refined sentiment summary is delivered as the final output, providing polished insights to the user.</li> <li>This showcases the integration of prompt engineering, generative AI, and advanced chaining techniques.</li> </ul> <p>This approach combines sequential, branching, and iterative chaining in Python with chat models and prompt engineering. It ensures robust processing of customer feedback, leveraging generative AI for keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and refinement.</p> <p>You need an IBM Cloud account to create a watsonx.ai project.</p> <p>While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook.</p> <ol> <li>Log in to watsonx.ai using your IBM Cloud account.</li> <li>Create a watsonx.ai project.

Few-shot examples or chatprompttemplate can help structure complex tasks requiring different prompts.</p> <p>Dependency: If outputs from one step are placeholders for the next prompt, use sequential chaining. Output parsers ensure smooth transition of outputs into structured inputs.</p> <p>Adaptability: For dynamic workflows, such as those involving langchain agents, iterative chaining allows real-time adjustments of parameters and next prompts.</p> <p>Data Modality: Choose workflows compatible with varied data types. Use embedding methods for text and vector data or LangChain Expression Language for flexible operations.</p> <p>By considering these factors, you can build a robust and adaptable LLM application with coherent chaining workflows.</p> <p>Prompt chaining is a versatile technique for building sophisticated NLP workflows.

Through this explicit prompt, the LLM would be more likely to produce desirable responses of higher quality.</p> <p>Soft prompts, unlike hard prompts, are not written in natural language. Instead, prompts are initialized as AI-generated, numerical vectors appended to the start of each input embedding that distill knowledge from the larger model. This lack of interpretability extends to the AI that chooses prompts optimized for a given task. Often, the AI is unable to explain why it chose those embeddings.

Common use cases of foundation models are chatbots and virtual assistants.</p> <p>There are several ways of improving a foundation model's interpretation of input and its quality of responses. To better understand these nuances, let's compare some of the methods.</p> <ul> <li><p>Prompt engineering is the optimization of a pretrained model's responses by providing a well-designed prompt. No new data is introduced using this technique and the model remains as-is. Using this method, the model receives an input prompt and an engineered prompt in front of it. For instance, you can use the prompt: \"Translate English to Spanish,\" with the input: \"good morning.\" This method requires more work from the user. However, this manual human effort to formulate effective prompts helps generative AI models produce task-specific responses without retraining the entire foundation model.</p> </li> <li><p>Fine-tuning large language models involves tuning the same model by providing large numbers of labeled datasets. Fine-tuning alters the model weights and becomes difficult to manage as tasks become diversified. This requires a significant amount of computational resources. In turn, this method tends to have the best accuracy since the model can be trained for very specific use cases.</p> </li> <li><p>Unlike fine-tuning, prompt tuning does not alter the pre-trained model weights. Instead, this technique is parameter-efficient by adjusting prompt parameters to guide the model\u2019s responses in the preferred direction. The model is provided with an input and tunable soft prompts generated by the AI itself. This task-specific context guides the massive model to tailor its responses to a narrow task even with limited data.</p> </li> <li><p>Similarly to prompt tuning, prefix-tuning (link resides outside ibm.com) involves the model receiving several examples of preferred output. The difference here is that a prefix, a series of task-specific vectors, is also included. Prefix-tuning involves both soft prompts and prompts injected into layers of the deep learning model. These so-called \"virtual tokens\" allow the tuned model the flexibility to support a variety of new tasks at once. This method achieves similar performance to fine-tuning all layers and only trains about 0.1% of the parameters.
